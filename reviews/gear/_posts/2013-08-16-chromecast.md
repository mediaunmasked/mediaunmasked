##Chromecast – $35

The television is the most immersive experience. To get YouTube to display onto your TV via Chromecast, just go to the YouTube app that you’re used to on your alternative device (phone, tablet and laptops) and you’ll notice a “cast” button on the UI. Simple press that button to play a video on your TV. Chromecast receives the video you played on your device, pulls the video you request directly from the cloud and plays it on your TV. Chromecast pulls the highest resolution offered from the cloud, so the hardware on your device doesn’t matter (this is great if you have a laptop that won’t play videos silky smooth). When you hit the “cast” button, Chromecast will turn on your TV, switch it to the right input and start playing your video in HD on the TV. You can also change the volume of your TV from your phone. You can add more YouTube videos to a “TV queue” so that they play consecutively in the order you added them in. You can multitask on your phone while watching videos on the TV. It continues to play in sleep mode and it’s easy to pause and skip the videos. iOS or Android, phones of all types can play videos on the TV and collaboratively create a queue. If a video is started on one device, it can be controlled from a completely different device. Any device in your home can become a remote control for your television. It’s not limited to videos; you can play any song in your library and it will play on the best speakers in your house. Pandora, Google Play and other apps are cooperative with Chromecast. The beta feature of Chromecast allows you to feature any Chrome tab directly to the TV. This could potentially grow to allow your home entertainment system, your TV, to be your home office as well in the house, and yet, people cannot consume the content they truly want to – nearly 50% of all downstream bandwidth is used by YouTube and Netflix in North America. This means that a vast majority of people prefer to consume online content over that of television. As Google always is, they introduced a new product called Chromecast. The innovative company saw that TVs were the only device being left in the dust in the online video section. Chromecast attempts to solve the problem that only few families actually use their great TVs to consume online content. A large barrier to viewing online content on a TV is to get the TVs actually connected. All devices should be able to get connected. Google allows this device to connect any operating system to access the great features offered. With only 2 inches in length, Google was able to make the device run a simplified version of Chrome OS. Simply connect through any HDMI port on your TV, power through USB and connect to your home Wi-Fi to set up the device and you’re ready to kick back and watch. It disappears behind your TV once Chromecast is plugged in!
