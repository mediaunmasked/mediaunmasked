<h2 id="what-use-do-you-have-for-the-lens">What Use Do You Have For The Lens?</h2>
<p><img src="http://i0.wp.com/i.imgur.com/gFgiWlS.jpg" alt="Canon 50mm Prime Lens Test Shot" class="thumbnail pull-right thumb" />
There are many lenses to choose from the DSLR family and it can be a bit daunting when you don’t know what you’re looking for. To start out, you should assess why you need a lens – will you be shooting animals in nature, portraits, close-ups, or everyday use? Also, what is your budget? Often, lenses will cost more than the camera body itself. I want to preface these suggestions by saying that I have owned, used and personally recommend each of the items below. I’m not a professional photographer, per se, but I have done some paid gigs. While they may not be the best glassware ever made, they do create high quality photographs at an affordable, hobbyist-level price range. Before picking the perfect one, you must first examine what you’ll be using the lens for. There are three major categories when deciding what type of lends you’ll be needing:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Zoom lens</strong> – animal, sports, or similar photography</li>
  <li><strong>Macro lens</strong> – extreme close-up shots</li>
  <li><strong>Wide angle</strong> lens – realty videos and landscape photography</li>
  <li><strong>Prime lens</strong> – no zoom, more crisp focus and image quality</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s further examine each style. Each have their benefits for different types of photography. When you consider your use, also keep in mind the quality of glass. For example, I have a prime lens that only cost around $100 and a zoom that cost maybe two or three times that; the prime lens creates a <em>much</em> sharper image and has a lower <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-number">f-number</a>, allowing for more light and depth of field in the image. Now, to examine the lenses that I would consider the top qualifying for each category:</p>

<h3 id="zoom-lens----265-or-105-see-below-55-250mm">Zoom Lens – $265 (or $105 see below) 55-250mm</h3>
<div class="thumbnail thumb-med pull-left">
	<img src="http://i2.wp.com/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Green_Bee-eater_-_Merops_orientalis.jpg/1024px-Green_Bee-eater_-_Merops_orientalis.jpg" alt="" />
	<div class="caption">

	</div>
</div>
<p>Quality zoom lenses are hard to find due to the amount of glass in them, and thus making them some of the most expensive lenses to choose from. My first zoom was the 55-250mm. It has a closest focal distance of 3.6 feet or 1.1m with image stabilization and autofocus. If light isn’t an issue, this piece of glass can do a great job for its price. The Canon EF-S 55-250mm telephoto lens has an f-number of f/4.0-5.6, allowing an adequate amount of light into the sensor. In order to get this lens for $105 on Amazon, you must get (or have gotten) “1 Qualifying EOS Rebel Digital SLR Cameras” from them and use the code <strong>T3WTBIXI</strong> at checkout. There are other special offers offered from Amazon, such as a 1 year warranty.</p>

<h3 id="macro-lens--12-extension-tubes">Macro Lens – $12 Extension Tubes</h3>
<p><img src="http://i2.wp.com/i.imgur.com/McE18am.jpg" alt="Canon 50mm with Fotodiox macro extension tubes" class="pull-right thumbnail thumb" />
This may have not been what you expected, but if you’re beginning into the hobby of photography or videography, I think it’s safe to assume you’re on a little bit of a budget. These extension tubes do require having a lens to start with, so you can’t expect to only pay $12 to start taking extreme closeup shots that are super sharp. These extension tubes are relatively simple; they extend your lens from your camera and keep it still, creating a zoomed-in effect that you would only expect to see with a macro. The great thing about these extension tubes is that it turns nearly any of your lenses into a macro lens. It is great with primes that let in a fair amount of light, such as the 50mm. Some of the features aren’t accessible on your lens (if it’s digitally controlled, as many are) while using the extension tubes because the lens itself isn’t physically connected to the camera body. It still takes great photos for a $12 addon! If you are looking for a more professional piece of glassware, check out the <a href="http://goo.gl/nQwKnX">100mm f/2.8 lens</a>. Here is a picture with the Canon 50mm lens and the Fotodiox macro extension tube set kit:</p>

<h3 id="wide-angle-lens--sigma-10-20mm">Wide Angle Lens – Sigma 10-20mm</h3>
<p>Wide angle lenses can be a bit tricky when looking for the right one because many of them are super expensive and or have a weird effect known as a fish-eye. If you’re looking to make skateboarding videos, music videos, or other types of videos that a GoProesque effect would add to the overall production, you might be interested in something like the <a href="http://goo.gl/LA6t1R">Rokinon 8mm F3.5 Fisheye</a>. While you get a weird effect with the lens, it is much wider and has a lower f-number, meaning it will allow more light and create more depth of field. But if you’re looking to minimize distortion and keep a majority of the picture as undistorted as possible, I recommend the Sigma 10-20mm.</p>

	</div>
</div>

<p>These lenses tend to have little or no barrel or pincushion distortion (they keep straight features straight instead of curving them). However, in these types of lenses, the rectilinear perspective creates things on the sides of the image to appear bigger than they are (almost stretching the outer edges a bit).</p>

<div class="thumbnail thumb-large">

	<div class="caption">
		Curvilinear ( [fisheye effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisheye_lens) )
	</div>
</div>

<p>This type of lens creates a much more exaggerated wide-angle image that distorts straight lines along the edges into more curvy lines. Initially used to study clouds with their “whole-sky” point of view, this hemispherical perspective lens adds a very distinct effect to your photographs or video. While not practical for every event, it certainly is worth considering.</p>

<h3 id="prime-lens-and-overall-favorite----50mm">Prime Lens (and overall favorite) – 50mm</h3>
<p>The number one entry-level lens rated by millions of people, the “nifty fifty” is a lens that can’t not be bought by anyone with a digital slr camera. The reason it’s so desirable is because it’s dirt cheap, but has amazing quality. It doesn’t take much to make photographs look professional and high quality with the 50mm lens and some decent light. Another huge benefit to the 50mm is the low f-number of f/1.8. The Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II lens allows in much more light, and a much more dramatic depth of field (so dramatic, the depth of field may be hard to control if recording video).</p>
