#Best Stand Up Computer Desk
---

{% include ad-post.html %}

If you’re like me, you spend a lot of time online and, therefore, a lot of time sitting. There is <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-kresser/sitting-health_b_2897289.html">data</a> online that show that sitting too much can be the cause for many health problems. So that means standing for a majority of that time at a stand up desk will prevent some of these issues, hopefully.

##Makeshift Stand Up Desk

In the 18th and 19th centuries, standing desks were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_desk">popular among the rich</a> (probably because only they owned offices in general). If you refuse to do a bit of exercise, you should really consider creating a standing/sitting desk such as the one I have set up. I use a [dual monitor mount]({% post_url 2013-05-23-best-mount %}) for my stand up/sit down combo desk. With it, I can slide up my two monitors and stand up my little tray (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&field-keywords=computer%20tray&linkCode=ur2&tag=mediunma0d-20&url=search-alias%3Daps" class="amazon">~$20-50 on Amazon</a>) and continue on with my internetting. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&field-keywords=stand%20up%20computer%20desk&linkCode=ur2&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Astand%20up%20computer%20desk&sprefix=stand%20up%20computer%20desk%2Caps&tag=mediunma0d-20&url=search-alias%3Daps" class="amazon">Stand up computer desks</a> are becoming popular as computer jobs become prevalent. After much research is done on the prolonged effects of sitting at a computer for many hours a day comes in, people become more interested and invested in the side-effects their career has taken them to. As I write this, standing up at my make-shift stand up desk, I know it may make my legs a bit heavy for about a week, but in the span of a lifetime, I’m glad that I’m doing this now. While standing is good for your healthy, some computing activities may require more focus and stability, or you just may want to sit sometimes. That’s why it’s great to get a computer desk that is adjustable, or in my case, I can easily remove the tray that is currently holding my keyboard and mouse from my desk, lower my monitors, and sit at my chair. Many people use books, shelves, and even soda pop cans.

##Exercise? Meh
Let’s be honest, we don’t always get as much exercise in as we’d like or we don’t even attempt to get exercise in. To have a great life experience, being healthy is a major factor. If you refuse to, or choose not to exercise, having a stand up desk can dramatically affect your well-being, especially in the long run. I’m not saying don’t exercise, I’m just pointing out these types of lifestyle changes are a great improvement to sitting (if you sit at a computer for long periods of time). The desks aren’t new, but they may be becoming more prevalent due to the prevalence of computer-oriented careers; consider giving it a try with some books, or pop cans, for a few days or weeks and then decide if it’s right for you.
