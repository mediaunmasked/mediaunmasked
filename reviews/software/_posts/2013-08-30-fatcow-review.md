#Cheap And Reliable Web Hosting – FatCow
---

{% include ad-post.html %}

I've used FatCow web hosting for a few years now, and I will explain my experiences in full transparency. As I am speaking from my experience, I can only review the hosting company from the perspective of only using them — I haven't used any other companies like GoDaddy, Domain, etc. It's been a great experience, and I'm hoping the same for the future.

Disclosure: I receive a kickback for referrals, so if you find this helpful, please use the link below.
Thanks.

##At-A-Glance
FatCow does what it’s meant to do and more. They host your files with (relatively) great uptime, meaning your website will be up and running most of the time. The company is, as a lot of web hosts are, a shared web host. They give you some startup money for advertising purposes, which can be great if you want to test the waters without risking anything extra. You get a free domain (they are only ~$15/year), roughly 25GB storage, user-friendly tools to help you make your site, unlimited emails, and more.
To quickly sum up my experience with FatCow in one phrase, it would be this — I’m still here, aren’t I? (Yes.)

##Quality & Uptime
###How Much Storage? Oodles, Not Unlimited
*FatCow. Great Web Hosting, No Bull*. is the slogan of the company, so I’ll cut the bull and tell you my experience. I signed up a few years ago with the understanding that they offered **unlimited** storage for a low rate of roughly ~$5 per month (after promotion). I use WordPress to run the sites I make and many plug-ins to integrate into them. WordPress has a plug-in that backs up your site every so often and I had it enabled. Little did I know, the archives it was creating automatically kept saving on the server, without replacing themselves (as they can be setup in the settings). Having more than **25GB** of data raised a red flag to FatCow, who then contacted me and essentially threatened to cancel my plan and delete all of my sites. As you can imagine, this was enough to make me want to switch providers, but after I found the problem, I deleted the unnecessary backups and I was fine. I decided to stick with FatCow, even after feeling deceived, because I figured most shared hosts have a similar cap. Whether it’s cell phone service providers, internet, or web hosting, unlimited is never unlimited. Now, FatCow promotes their hosting as ***Oodles***; I’d like to think because of my mishap.

###Customer Service
The experience I’ve had with the customer service has been positive. They have been able to figure out my problem and help me fix it(except the time I had used 25GB of storage; they simply advised me to delete some files). Being open 24×7 really helps for those long nights of working on a website or any other time of day — they’re open.

###Uptime
Uptime – the amount of time that your site is up. Anyone with a website expects it to be up all the time, especially if you’re renting space on servers somewhere around the world. If you have a website that gets many thousands of views per month and requires 100% uptime, you will likely want to look at dedicated hosting and not shared hosting. Shared hosting is a cheaper way to get your sites online. There have been times that I go to a site I make and find it to be offline. They are usually good about it, but expect it to be down 1% of the time (may be more, may be less).

Glitchiness
This review will be most beneficial to you if you know the good and bad. I want to be transparent with what I, and people I know, have experienced that might affect your decision on web hosts. Occasionally (maybe once in 3000 visits [hasn't happened to me for a long time]) a page on one of my sites will load the HTML document, rather than what the browser should have interpreted it as (colors, images, the website). I’m not 100% sure if it’s the host or browser (Chrome) that causes this, but I’ve not experienced it on any other site, nor have the people who’ve contacted me about seeing it happen on my sites. I’m not exactly sure why it happened.

##Alternate Option -- Dedicated Servers
FatCow is currently in a beta transition to offering dedicated hosting. That is, you get your own server to yourself, speeding up your site for high traffic circumstances. They add extra security by mirroring your files to ensure data protection. The con to this alternative hosting plan is that you will be paying for it. You get what you pay for. The prices can range from $65 per month, for 2 cores, 4 GB of RAM, 500 GB of storage, and 5 TB bandwidth, to $120 per month, for 4 cores, 16 GB of RAM, 1 TB storage, and 15 TB of bandwidth. These prices are currently (time of post) 50% off due to them still being in beta. They also provide you with an expert support team. Needless to say, it’s not for those getting into web design or hobbyists. This limits the speed that your website viewers can see your site (which is pretty important).

##Wrap-Up
FatCow has been great, which is why I am still a loyal customer. The 24×7 customer support can be very helpful for any problem you may have. While the labels may have deceived me initially, I continue to use FatCow because they do the job. Just be aware that they are an option; there are others, but you’re in good hands with FatCow. They’ve got the user-friendly tools to make everything on your site (design, [custom emails](http://mediaunmasked.com/custom-email/), easy blog setup, etc) and some good support — you don’t need much more. The run great promotions, offer a free domain name with your plan, and hey, they’re 100% wind-powered.
