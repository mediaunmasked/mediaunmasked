#Free Business Cards To Promote Your Business

A few months ago, I was hired to take photographs at a neighboring state for a majorette competition. I wasn’t well known to the performers or the audience that watched them and I wanted to get some recognition. A few weeks before I went, I remembered hearing about Vista Print on a [Pandora](http://pandora.com/) ad. They offered **250 FREE business cards**; can’t beat that price. Going into it, I figured there was a catch; there always is.

##What’s The Catch?
I knew I would have to pay a decent shipping cost, but it should still be worth it. After going on their website, choosing from the limited themes for my free order, designed something I was proud of and dodged their marketing sales, I was able to get a pretty sweet deal. The card themes were tailored toward a wide varieties of businesses such as lawn care, computer repair, construction, and a lot more business cards. This is why I am recommending [vistaprint](http://vistaprint.tellapal.com/a/clk/1lwRKJ). Before clicking the final submit button, they threw in 250 more cards for a cheap price (I think it was maybe $5-$10) with no extra shipping costs. They also tried to sell me some overpriced calendars, website designs and other printable items, which I declined. If you’re looking to promote your business at an event you plan to attend in the future, maybe you should consider different printing companies that offer business cards to bring, but keep in mind it might take as long as two or even three weeks for some companies to be able to ship them out to you, so try to put in your order as soon as possible if you need them before an event.

***Update***: Printing companies often run promotions, and although I don’t know if vistaprint is *currently* running the promotion, I do know you can get 250 for only $10 (this is roughly what I paid for the shipping of my "free" 250 business cards).
