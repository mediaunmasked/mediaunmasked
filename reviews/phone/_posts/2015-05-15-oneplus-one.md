#OnePlus One Phone Review
---

#Introduction
Ever since my first phone went through the washer, I searched far and wide for a phone that was powerful and big enough to do the many things I wanted in a phone and still fit in my pocket and hand comfortably. The more I searched, the more I found myself liking the flagship phones like the Samsung Galaxy Note, S6, HTC One, LG G4, etc. These, however, cost much more than I was willing to spend, so I almost settled for the established [Motorola Moto G](http://amzn.to/1Fpj02s), which probably the best bang for your buck phone at under $200. Then, I found a couple YouTube videos on a little phone called the OnePlus One. The company is called OnePlus, and their first phone model is the One. In short, it's a great phone that most owners are pretty happy with.

##What's important in a phone
There are reasons everyone in the world has a phone and is constantly on it, but those reasons may vary slightly. Most people primarily use their phone for communication, but it can be a tool for so much more than that. The reasons, other than communication, for me, are that this piece of hardware can be used for:

* GPS
* Games & movies
* Web development (testing)
* DSLR monitor
* Teleprompter
* FPV flying, VR, 360 video, etc.

##Specs
* Price: $350 (for 64 GB grey) or $300 (for 16 GB white)
* Resolution: 1080p
* Screen size: 5.5 in.
* Battery: 3100mAh (iPhone 6 is 1810mAh for comparison)
* RAM: 3GB DDR3
* CPU: Snapdragon 801 2.5 GHz Quad-Core
* Storage: 64 GB or 16 GB
* Color: "Sandstone black" (grey) or "silk white" (white)
* Camera: 13 MP (back) 5 MP (front)

###Design
The OnePlus One comes in two colors: grey and white. The "silk white" one comes with 16 GB of storage for $300 and the "sandstone black" one has 64 GB of storage for $350 (this is the model I got). The back has a material like no other phone I've felt before with a somewhat "felt" feeling. It's nice to touch, but I bought a [cheap case](http://amzn.to/1L887ko) to go with mine. I also got a strong [screen protector](http://amzn.to/1FpmhyG) in case I drop the $350 piece of hardware. They both have a near bevel-less design with the standard capacitive buttons on the bottom that can be used or have the option to have buttons on the screen in the software, which is Oxygen OS, replacing what was initially on the One: Cyanogen. Three microphones are placed throughout the phone to help isolate your voice and reduce background noise. Simple things like double-tapping the screen to wake your phone or drawing a simple image on your screen to open a specific app really enhance your overall experience. The phone itself fits nicely in my skinny-normal-sized hands with the buttons easily accessible when held with one hand (they are lower than other phones and the sleep button is on the side opposite the volume rocker, instead of on top).
###In the box
For a company that touts not spending much on marketing to pass its savings on to the user (which is great for those of us who find out about the phone), the product box, website, and overall design of the phone is simple, clean, and beautiful. In the box, you get the phone, a USB charger (that seemed a slightly wider than other USB inputs I've used, but still fit) with a wall adapter.

##Features
My previous phone hadn't had OTG support, so I made sure my new phone would so I could use any USB device, such as the output video on a video transmitter (for RC FPV flight with cardboard and my phone), a DSLR video signal (to use as an external monitor), a keyboard, mouse, USB storoage, etc. If you have a camera, phone, or VR phone holder like Google Cardboard that uses NFC technology, the OnePlus One will work with it. The One also supports 4G, bluetooth, Miracast, GPS, and most (or even more) features that you'd find on any other "flagship" phone.

I specifically wanted a pretty powerful phone for its potential use of features. We live in a time where our phones can do so much and, for specific people, replace some of the gadgets we use today. For example, most phones have GPS built into them, so we can type in a location into Google Maps and get turn-by-turn navigation to our destination. To begin or alter the trip, however, you need to have data (wifi, 4G, etc.) or use an app that downloads selected maps. This basically replaces the need for a dedicated GPS device.

###FPV, virtual reality, and video monitor
Phones are essentially just monitors. Some people have dedicated monitors like the ones from [Oculus](https://www.oculus.com/order), to be able to experience the new field of virtual reality for gaming, specifically. Much of the hardware and software (games) are still being developed for this new wave of technology. Later, there were companies selling dedicated head mounts for your phone, which cuts down on cost and makes sense, since they are essentially the same thing as what you get from the dedicated monitors (to an extent). So, Google being Google, creates a free PDF on how to make your own head mount for your phone out of cardboard. Since then, you can buy [pre-cut kits](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&pub=5575049629&toolid=10001&campid=5337335986&customid=&icep_uq=google+cardboard&icep_sellerId=&icep_ex_kw=&icep_sortBy=12&icep_catId=&icep_minPrice=&icep_maxPrice=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229466&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg) on eBay, lenses and magnets included for under $5. This, in combination with software like Limelight and Trinus Gyre enables you to play PC games with a high-resolution VR set, for free.

With the same hardware, we can eliminate yet another $300 set of dedicated video goggles like the ones from [Fatshark](http://amzn.to/1EavyU2), while being able to fly an RC helicopter (also known as a "drone") for filming or fun. These goggles are specifically designed for this purpose (offering different features), but since it's just a monitor, we can use a free app (I haven't found one that doubles the image, so I'm not sure how to use cardboard just yet) and a cheap $5 OTG cable from eBay to receive and show the video signal from a (not so cheap) [$50 module](http://laserbgc.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=75) + [$50 USB adapter for the module](http://laserbgc.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=82). Still much cheaper than the dedicated goggles!

While we're at it, why not use the OnePlus One alongside my DSLR camera as an external monitor? With the bigger display and another cheap wire mount, I can attach it to the camera body or even a 3-axis gimbal to give me both what's being captured (with a *slight* delay) and controls of the camera settings without needing to touch the camera (specifically helpful if used with a gimbal).

###Games, movies, and web development
Although I don't play many games on my phone (I have a computer for that), the ones I have played run smooth and look amazing on the 1080p display. With a ["spider" wire mount](http://amzn.to/1Eaymke), my phone can be hung or rested from different positions while I watch a movie or use it while developing a website for mobile screens (auto-updated with [BrowserSync](http://www.browsersync.io/)). I even found a [text editor app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aor.droidedit) - so, while not practical, I could do the coding on it with my bluetooth mouse and USB keyboard via the OTG adapter.

##Conclusion
Again, if you're looking for a phone to just text, call, and do basic phone stuff, but still want the versatility of a smart phone, I recommend checking out the [Moto G](http://amzn.to/1Fpj02s). If you're like me and are wanting a little more in a phone or have considered getting a "flagship" phone for its power/features (and not its status), then the OnePlus One might be the phone you've been looking for. I hope this review has helped save you some money and show you some of the potential that a phone can offer. I've had this phone for a few months now and I will say that it is worth the money if you were planning on spending this much anyway. It's the best price for performance that I found when searchign for a phone.
