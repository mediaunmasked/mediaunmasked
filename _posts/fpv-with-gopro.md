#FPV With GoPro Hero 3 Black Edition
---

Hey. Today I’ll be reviewing the GoPro Hero 3 black edition. I bought this camera on Amazon during a black friday deal for a little under $250 to use on my rc helicopter, but right now they’re about $350.

Starting out with the stats, it can shoot 4k at 12 fps in ultra wide angle, 2.7k in 24, 25 and 30fps as ultra wide angle, 1440p at 24, 25, 30 and 48 fps at ultra wide angle, 1080p at 24, 25, 30, 48, 50 and 60 fps at ultra wide, medium and narrow angles, 960p at 48 and 100 fps at ultra wide angle, 720p at 50, 60, 100 and 120 fps at ultra wide, medium and narrow angles, and WVGA at 240 fps at ultra wide angle.

There have been known problems with the GoPro Hero 3 stopping when recording with certain settings, due to the writing speed of some cards, but I think that’s only an issue if you don’t have a fast enough card. I got the SanDisk Extreme 32 GB microSDHC class 10 card and it seems to work fine.

There’s a list of cards that are compatible with the Hero 3 on the GoPro website linked below this video. Here I’ll be showing off some of the footage you can get with the camera under different conditions with different settings. You can click the annotations on the screen to see a specific example do nothing to see them all.

**Aerial** (jello)
This clip is shot at 1080p at 60 frames per second at a medium viewing angle and will showcase what I personally bought it for, FPV flying, but it will also show the low light capability and a rolling shutter jello effect due to the helicopter’s vibrations.

**Detail** (macro)
This clip is shot at 4k at 12 frames per second at ultra wide angle and is meant to show the Hero 3’s focus on detail. Keep in mind this video was rendered at 1080p so it won’t depict the true quality and you might want to watch this in higher resolution to get a more accurate depiction of the quality.

**Underwater** (slow motion)
This clip is shot at 720p at 120 frames per second at a narrow viewing angle and is meant to show the slow motion.

Overall, you can’t complain with the technology packed into such a small package and hopefully we’ll see these improvements continue. If you get a decent microSDHC card you should be good to go. If you’ve got any questions about the Hero 3, leave a comment and I’ll try to respond as soon as I can.
Also, there’s a link below this video to see how much it is on Amazon and thanks for watching.
