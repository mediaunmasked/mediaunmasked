#Intro To Web Development
---

{% include vid.html %}

**EVERYONE** needs a website. Whether it be business, hobby or personal, there are 20 different reasons you need a website. There is a ton of information out there on web design, but I’m going to share with you what I know and what I learn along the way. I’ll try to make it as understandable and concise as possible. This tutorial is intended for people who are excited to dive into their first project!

***Disclaimer**: I’m constantly trying to learn and if I’m able to teach you how to make your own clean and fully custom website from zero experience and zero dollars, then this series will have accomplished its goal.*

I’ve broken this post series down into **6** different posts that will cover the key points that you’ll need to know to start your own website from not knowing anything about web development previously. At the end of each page, I’ll include all of the resources mentioned during the post. Let’s get started!

This video series is to introduce website development for beginners who don’t know anything about making websites. This first episode introduces the software I use in my workflow to make websites to the best of my ability. This series assumes you don’t know anything about web development, but if I go beyond what you understand, ask me a question and I’ll try to get back to you as soon as possible!
