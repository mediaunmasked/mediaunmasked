#How To Convert VCR Tapes to Digital (or CD)
---

Don’t let your memories be forgotten. If you’re like me, there’s no amount of money that can be traded for your home video. As I write this article, I’m backing up and converting these physical pieces of film and plastic into the digital realm. “How can he do such wizardry?” you might be asking yourself. It’s quite simple really. You just need some hardware (In my case, I’m using a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BA4ILX8/tag=mediunma0d-20" class="amazon">Hauppauge Box</a>), software (usually comes with the hardware), and patience to convert those old tapes into something easily accessible — you’ll thank me later!

##Converting Your Tapes

###Hauppauge Box
To begin the converting process, I recommend either buying an external hard drive or backing the home videos up on YouTube (this can take a long time; you might want to upgrade your internet speeds for a month, depending on how many videos you plan to backup (I did this — it was 5x faster upload than my current internet plan). If your internet provider limits your bandwidth, you might want to avoid backing them up on YouTube and stick with the external hard drive or a CD.

This little doohickey allows you to record whatever you plug into it. It’s essentially a screen recording software, but the hardware is required so it can be a bit pricey. You need the hardware in order to project  the video from a video output to your computer, which is the input. From there, you will effectively be screen recording your computer to convert your tapes to digital. If you ever thought of recording tv programs, movies or video games then the Hauppauge 1512 HD-PVR is a great choice. However, if you simply want to keep old memories from disappearing, then perhaps a cheaper alternative Hauppauge Box would be a better purchase. For either one, you will need to have enough time to play the tape to its full extent and then be at your computer to stop its recording. Keep in mind, if you have a lot of tapes to back up, this may fill up your hard drive.

##Burn Files To CD
Once you’ve recorded one tape (or a portion of it), you should now either upload it to YouTube directly or prepare it for a disc. I recommend avoiding editing these clips because most video editing programs only work with fixed frame rates, and the recording box I used recorded the tapes in a variable frame rate (most probably do). With the file on your computer, use a program such as <a href="http://www.dvdstyler.org/en/">DVD Styler</a>. You can burn single files as a normal DVD, or multiple files as a thumb drive, with Windows operating system (and possibly others). DVD Styler lets you add basic and customized menus to your DVD and is great if you have multiple files to add to the disk. When I made my home tapes into DVDs, it divided the video into roughly 10 minute segments, which is very helpful when you have hours of footage to sift through (if you’re looking for a particular moment).
