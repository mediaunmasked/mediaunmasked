#How To Change Your Eye Color With Photoshop
---

{% include ad-post.html %}

Changing the color of someone’s eyes is very easy in Photoshop. I’ll be using Photoshop CS6 in this tutorial, but it is virtually the same in most other versions.

##Select the area
To start out, you’ll need to select the area that you’re trying to change the color of (in this case, the cat’s eyes). To make the selection process easier, you can hold in Z and click and drag to zoom into the selection area. I prefer to use the quick selection tool (shortcut W) to do the major selections and then refine it by using the lasso tool (shortcut L).

##Refine Edge
Once you have the area selected, you can hit “Refine Edge…” to change the selections settings a bit more.

##Add Adjustment
Now that you’ve got your selection refined, it’s time to change the colors. Select the fill/adjustment layer at the bottom of your layers panel and choose Hue/Saturation.

##Pick The Color
Now, to make the newly created adjustment layer only affect the layer below it (the eyes), you need to click this button:

Last but not least, start adjusting the color by sliding the “Hue” slider. You can also give it some saturation boosts to add color, but it’s not necessary to pull of the effect.
