#How To Learn HTML Tags
---

{% include vid.html %}

This video series is to introduce website development for beginners who don’t know anything about making websites. This episode introduces the use of HTML tags, which is the basic format that websites are written in. This series assumes you don’t know anything about web development, but if I go beyond what you understand, ask me a question and I’ll try to get back to you as soon as possible!
