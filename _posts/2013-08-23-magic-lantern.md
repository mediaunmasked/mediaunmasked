<a href="http://www.magiclantern.fm/">Magic Lantern</a> is an add-on that runs on your SD card for your DSLR camera that enables you to do many things that you can’t do with the normal firmware from Canon or Nikon. It is free, open source and used by millions around the world. Magic Lantern allows you to shoot times lapse photography, HDR photography/video, and much more.

Here is a list of some of the benefits Magic Lantern brings to your camera:

* Silent picture timelapse. Only for very advanced users.
