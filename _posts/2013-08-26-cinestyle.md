#How To Use Cinestyle Custom Camera Preset By Technicolor
---

{% include ad-post.html %}

Canon and other camera companies have done an excellent job in creating their cameras. This includes the color presets that are put onto the cameras — what makes the camera look the way it does. If you notice, what you record actually looks different than in real life, however minimally. This is because most cameras currently do not shoot in RAW, so they must compress the files by making them into a .jpg file extension or a similar output. Luckily, they are customizable so that you can later edit the colors to suite the mood of your video later.

##Color Presets
Cameras shoot video in a compressed format, unless it is a high-end prosumer camera (such as Red cameras), to maintain a manageable file. High-end cameras create a RAW video file that is essentially the pure data, uncompressed and, therefore, creates a huge file size (most cameras that shoot RAW need an external hard drive, much faster and larger than a traditional SD card). While having a smaller file size may be good for the average uses, it comes with its limits in post-production. It can make the initial file less editable, in that it already has an ‘edit’ on it. The RAW files allow for much more manipulation when it comes to color correcting and grading. Why does this matter? Well, the least amount of adjustment that has been added during the recording, the better (that is, if you plan to color grade it later). If you plan to record something quickly and don’t plan to do too many adjustments, it might be to your advantage to use a preset that comes with your camera, but if you want a color profile that has very little adjustments alongside it, technicolor’s Cinestyle profile gives a flat image that preserves a lot of the data to be manipulated later.

##Technicolor Cinestyle
Technicolor’s website says the Cinestyle profile allows you to "harness the full potential of your Canon EOS DSLR Camera ... a free <a href="https://www.technicolorcinestyle.com/media-upload/color-profile.zip">download</a> that boosts the dynamic range in your camera." You can download Technicolor’s color profile from <a href="https://www.technicolorcinestyle.com/">their website</a>. Unfortunately, this profile is only for Canon cameras, but there are probably similar alternatives for other camera brands. Cinestyle makes your video have greater detail in both the highlights and shadows of your shot. By not doing any adjustments during the recording process, the picture profile preserves the most amount of detail and provides great flexibility in post-production.
