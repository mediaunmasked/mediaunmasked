#HDR Photography Tutorial Using Magic Lantern

<a href="http://www.magiclantern.fm/">Magic Lantern</a> gives you the flexibility to enhance your photography and videography to the camera’s limits. Magic Lantern is a free firmware update that gives you the opportunity to use your camera with a built in intervalometer (for time lapse photography), monitor audio input, audio and motion detection to trigger a photo, and much more, including HDR (High Dynamic Range). Most hobby-level, or at least not professional grade, cameras have built in color profiles that, more or less, add color adjustments to help compress the file and make the image look more appealing. While this is great in some cases, if you want your photographs or video to look more professional and you’d like to preserve the information in the image, consider downloading <a href="http://www.technicolor.com/">Technicolor</a>'s free profile called CineStyle. CineStyle minimizes the amount of adjustments added during the recording, giving more wiggle-room in post.
Before continuing, I recommend getting Cinestyle and, of course, installing Magic Lantern onto your card.
