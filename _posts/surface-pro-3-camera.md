#Surface Pro 3 Camera Quality Test Shots
---

The Surface Pro 3 has two built in cameras and two stereo mics that are 5 MegaPixels and shoot 1080p video, but youâ€™ll probably mostly just use it for Skype or your occasional use. To open the camera without an app, go to start and click camera and then choose either the camera or video button. You can also quickly take a photo or video from the lock screen by swiping down from the edge of the lock screen and then tap the camera or video.

When recording a video, you can tap on the screen to take a photo without stopping the video.
