#Best Ways To Earn Money By Searching Google/Bing
---


There are many different ways you can use <a href="http://swagbucks.com/refer/MediaUnmasked" target="_blank">SwagBucks</a> to earn points that can be redeemed for money by doing things online. There are other programs similar to SwagBucks, that encourage people to use their product, such as Microsoft's search engine, Bing. While there are dozens of online rewarding sites, I think it's pretty well-known that SwagBucks is probably the best, in terms of usability and rewards. There are many different ways to earn SwagBucks, including the following:
<ul>
	<li>Search</li>
	<li>No obligation special offers (NOSO)</li>
	<li>Daily crave</li>
	<li>Daily poll</li>
	<li>Watch videos</li>
	<li>Play games</li>
	<li>Fill out offers</li>
	<li>Shop</li>
</ul>
<h3>Search</h3>
SwagBucks makes it possible for you to earn more by doing different activities, but the traditional method and probably the most reliable is just by using the search engine, which is a combination of Google and Bing results. The most popular and probably the <strong>best method of getting SwagBucks</strong> is by simply setting your search engine to use SwagBucks. Because Swagbucks uses Google and Bing results, you won't be missing any of the content that you would have found otherwise. The layout is a bit different, but I actually like the image and video result page better than Google's. Each browser allows you to get a toolbar, extension, or plugin of some sort that makes it easier to do all the activities related to earning SwagBucks, including search. If you're using Google Chrome, the process to set up SwagBucks as your default search engine (when you search in the address bar) is quite simple.

<img class="alignright" src="http://i.imgur.com/F0V9HGY.jpg" alt="" width="503" height="247" />
<ol>
	<li>Right click the address bar at the top of Chrome and select "Edit search engines..."</li>
	<li>Scroll down until you see the form to add a new search engine</li>
	<li>In the first field, type in Swagbucks</li>
	<li>In the second field, type in any keyword you want.</li>
	<li>In the third field, paste the following: http://www.swagbucks.com/?f=2&amp;t=w&amp;p=1&amp;q=%s</li>
	<li>Now, click the blue "Make default" button to the right (when you hover your mouse over it)</li>
	<li>Now when you type anything in the top bar, you'll use SwagBucks to search for it</li>
</ol>

Just set it as your default browser and forget about it. You'll occasionally earn anywhere from about 5-50 points on a search. Search when you need to search and the points will add up. I believe there is a limit to the amount of points you can earn by searching per hour, so just use it as normal and don't try to game the system.
<h3>Swag Codes</h3>
Often there is a code that SwagBucks will shout on their social media and, when entered, will get you some free points. Some days there are many and some days there is only one code. To make it easier, there are sites like swagcode spoilers that post the codes directly on their site. If you only do two things to get SwagBucks, it would be search and enter the codes (some days they give out many worth many points, so it's worth it).
<h3>No Obligation Special Offers (NOSO)</h3>
This is a pretty simple one. You just click skip on all the offers and you're rewarded with two SwagBucks!

<h3>Daily Crave</h3>
Daily crave is a new feature they introduced that reminds me a lot like StumpleUpon. The difference is that you need to stay on the featured site for about 40 seconds before you can go to the next. Once you visit two sites, you get a whopping 1 SwagBuck. Not the best reward, but it's another way to earn. You can do this as much as you want.
<h3>Daily Poll</h3>
To earn another 1 SwagBuck, you can do the daily poll. It's as simple as going to the poll page, clicking an option, and then submitting it. Much faster than the daily crave, but you're limited to one per day.
<h3>Watch Videos</h3>
If you want to get a few more SwagBucks by doing other activities, they offer different options, one of which is watching videos. On the desktop site, you need to watch 10 videos to get the reward, which is 3 SwagBucks. The videos can be a few minutes long each, so this process can take a while. I mean, you watch YouTube videos for free, so this isn't that bad. Some of the videos are actually entertaining. If you want it to run in the background muted, that's fine too. You can earn up to 150 a day by doing this.

There's also an app for Android and iOS called SwagBucks TV. Unlike the desktop video player, the app will autoplay each video (with an advertisement) and reward you 2 SwagBucks every 5 videos watched. Sometimes the app will stop and give you an error, but sometimes I just turn it on and let it go, so it plays in the background.
<h3>Play Games</h3>
For this section, you basically need to watch a preroll ad and then play a game for some points, depending on your score. If you use an ad blocker, you'll need to disable it if you want to get points playing the games. You'll also need Adobe flash player because the games are flash games. I would only recommend this method if you really enjoy the game and find it entertaining, seeing as the payout isn't great. If you're <em>really</em> into a particular game, you can participate in a tournament. Tournaments have an entry fee of a few SwagBucks and the first, second, and third place people get a SwagBucks payout.
<h3>Fill Out Offers</h3>
There are special offers, similar to the no obligation special offers, but these have an obligation for you to do, but you'll earn more points. If you fill out these forms, you might want to use a dedicated spam email, because they're likely to send you some.
<h3>Shop</h3>
If you shop under the categories listed on the <a href="http://www.swagbucks.com/shop" target="_blank">SwagBucks shop page</a>, you can earn a specified amount of SwagBucks per dollar spent, which can be nice if you planned on buying something anyway. I haven't yet used this, but there are many stores supported - even Amazon!
<h3>Trade In</h3>
You can trade in your old electronics or books for some SwagBucks. Sometimes trade in programs aren't the best way to get the most money from your old things, so beware. Remember that roughly 100 SwagBucks = 1 dollar if you're buying gift cards. However, if you're looking to just get rid of old games, maybe the trade in program would be perfect.
<h3>Accelerator Program</h3>
SwagBucks is completely free to get everything it has to offer, but if you know you earn enough points to justify it, you can sign up for their Accelerator Program that will double or triple your earnings. The first level doubles your points earned up to 700 points that costs $5 per month. Anything above that and you're profiting. The top level costs $10 per month but triples your SwagBucks rewards up to 1500 per month. So, the only justification to buying this would be if you're sure you can get at least 450 points in a month.
<h3>Rewards</h3>
So what do you do with yet another digital currency? Well, with certain amount of SwagBucks, you can buy different gift cards - the most popular and cheapest being Amazon. There are also physical items that you can purchase, but they cost <em>a lot</em> more than small gift cards (and in some cases it's more economically efficient to get the gift cards). I've gotten over $100 in Amazon gift cards since I started searching with SwagBucks. I bought my <a href="http://amzn.to/1sfrUZA" target="_blank">Logitech G9x mouse</a> with it, which I use every day. You're not going to be making a lot of money in a short amount of time, but the bonus money is a nice little reward that you're currently not getting by using traditional search engines. You can give it a try if you'd like (it's free, of course) - <a href="http://swagbucks.com/refer/MediaUnmasked" target="_blank">sign up</a> and start your long journey to earn some Amazon gift cards just by doing your everyday searches!
