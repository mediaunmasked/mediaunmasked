#How To Make A Text Image
---

In this tutorial, I’ll show you step by step how to create an image using words from predertermined text like the example to the left. It’s pretty easy to make specific quotes or other predefined words the makeup of an image. In this example, I used an image of a couple of soldiers holding up an American flag with ally tanks in the background. To construct the image, I used specific colors and words to correspond with the specific color and light range of the image. You can include as complex or simple of detail as you wish. The example in this tutorial will show the basic method of creating such images so you can get the basic understanding of it and try it yourself!

##Reference
This effect can create some great banners to promote something or even just a really great graphic image. To make it look as real as possible, the image you use should have a decent amount of highlights, midtones and shadows. You can use the image I’ll be using in this tutorial. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/xWGHz7e.jpg">Download it here</a>.

##Text Image — Instructions

* Start by importing your image into Photoshop and click on select (at the top of the screen) -> color range -> shadows.
* Press ctrl+c and ctrl+j to copy the area and create a new layer with the selected areas only.
* Now select -> color range -> mid tones and then ctrl+c, ctrl+j again.
* Once more, select -> color range -> highlights and ctrl+c, ctrl+j to make a new layer with the highlights.
* **Note** — *at this point, you can continue the previous steps to achieve more detail.*
* Now that you have the image divided into layers based on the picture’s shading, you can begin texting the image.
* Deselect the background layer.
* Select the mid-tones layer and go to Edit -> Fill -> 50% Gray (with preserve transparency **checked**).
* Select the shadow-tones layer and go to Edit -> Fill -> Black (with preserve transparency **checked**).
* Now select the two layers you just edited and right click and select Merge Layers.
* Make a new document.
* Using the text tool (T), paste or type your text into the new document.
* Use the marquee selection tool (M) to select the text.
* Navigate to Edit -> Define Brush Preset… -> name the brush.
* Now close the document with the text on it.
* On the image document, create a new layer.
* Hit ctrl + backspace to fill the layer with white. Now hide this layer.
* Using the brush tool (B), select the brush you had just created.
* Create a new layer and brush in the area and hide that layer.
* Select the mid-tone and shadow layer.
* Press ctrl+a to select it and ctrl+c to copy it.
* Click the text layer (make it visible) and add a new layer mask.
* Press alt and click on the layer mask.
* Now paste the layer onto that mask using ctrl+v.
* Press ctrl+d to deselect the area and ctrl+i to invert the layer mask.
* Now select the text-image (rather than the mask).
* **Add style** — Choose gradient overlay.
* Now you can change the colors of the gradient (make sure the blending mode is set to screen).
* Select a soft brush, with an opacity of ~20%.
* Now paint over the text layer (not the mask) with black. This adds some features back to the image.
