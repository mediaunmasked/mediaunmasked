#$50 HD Waterproof Action Cam Review
---

Hey guys, in this video I’ll be reviewing a $50 HD waterproof action cam, depending on when and where you buy it, made by Sharper Image. I got it for $40 near Christmas, but when I recently checked, it was $58 on Amazon. To me, what sells the camera is the GoPro-like packaging, as well as the images, obviously not taken by the camera, featured on the box. Almost every camera made today is quote unquote, HD. That just means the resolution is at least 720 pixels wide in a 16 by 9 aspect ratio. It comes with a 4 GB micro SD card, which is like 5 dollars on Amazon. The box also says it has 8 megapixels, but if the sensor is horrible, then that doesn’t matter much. Unfortunately, the quality isn’t great. However, it comes with a waterproof case, a sports mounting kit and even has a display on the camera, something GoPros don’t even feature. The action cam uses a rechargeable lithium-ion battery that you plug into your computer to charge.
OPEN BOX N TALK ABOUT IT
Here’s the camera in comparison to a GoPro Hero 3 in size and quality. What’s nice about the camera is that it’s cheap and, if you happen to be into aerial video or a sport where you just want a record of the event, you might find a good use for this camera for the price. If you’re in it for quality alone, I would recommend putting that money towards a better camera or lens because this one just doesn’t compete with modern camera quality.
