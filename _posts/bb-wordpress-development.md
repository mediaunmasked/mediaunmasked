##E1 - Introduction to wordpress
WordPress is easily one of the most powerful and popular tools in web development. Itâ€™s a content management system that many big names and popular websites use. The difference in it and a traditional HTML page is that it uses PHP and databases to dynamically create the page as it is loaded to the user. Because it has gained popularity over the years, it is very powerful, so you can do very little to get a nice WordPress site up and running, or you can do as much as you want to make it as unique as you want. If you want to do very little, you can check out my video on how to install WordPress linked below this video. In this video, I hope to introduce you to enough PHP tags that you will be able to understand the concept of working with WordPress.
