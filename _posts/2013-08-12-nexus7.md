##Google Nexus 7 Tablet (2nd Generation) – $229
Senior vice president at Google, Sundar Pichai, announced on July 24, 2013 that the new Nexus 7 would be released to the public. Pichai says that, in our multi-screen world, Google is here to embrace the trending technology and make it beautiful and consistent across all devices. By using the largest open platform for mobile devices, Android, Google is able to encourage developers around the world to create thousands of apps for it. As the chart below suggests, by the end of 2013, consumers are going to buy more tablets every year than personal computers. With over 1 million apps, the largest collection of digital books and millions of songs and other digital content, Google Play creates a great experience for the future of tablets. The new design of Nexus 7 is almost 2 mm slimmer than the original Nexus 7, 6 mm narrower, and 50g lighter. With the black on black, minimalistic design, the Nexus 7 has a better and greater screen. While the screensize is still 7″, it packs a whopping true 1080p at 1920 x 1200 resolution, versus the former, 1280 x 800. The device has gone from 216 pixels/inch, in 2012, to 323 pixels/inch now, making the new Nexus 7 the world’s highest resolution 7″ tablet. The tablet’s text and images have a better quality than the highest quality print magazine and it illuminates a 30% wider range of colors. The audio in the second generation Nexus 7 tablet is dual stereo but also features a virtual surround sound of 5.1 speaker system when using headphones. The two cameras feature a 1.2MP front camera and 5MP rear camera for photos and 1080p video. The higher ram allows for faster application response and switching, the quad core 1.5GHz Snapdragon S4 Pro chipset, 80% faster CPU and a graphics processing unit that is 4 times faster than the previous Nexus 7 tablet. This hardware offers amazing potential to those who like gaming. The operating system, Android 4.3, encompasses a new industry standard in video graphics, Open GLES 3.0, which allows game developers the integration of hyper-realistic graphics. It allows for multiple accounts per tablet and age restrictions for each user that can limit users to content, such as purchasable content. It obviously comes with dual band Wi-Fi (802.11 a/b/g/n), Bluetooth 4.0, and even a 4G LTE version of the Nexus 7. There is an HDMI output, NFC and wireless charging. The battery performance outdoes its predecessor at about an hour extra battery life, giving it up to 9 hours of HD video playback and 10 hours of web browsing. Google Play has taken advantage of the new hardware for excellent gaming. They are also joining up with the top 5 major textbook companies to sell and rent textbooks to students.

So, for exactly half the cost of an iPad mini, the quality of this tablet is astonishing and blows other tablets out of the water in terms of the general user experience.
