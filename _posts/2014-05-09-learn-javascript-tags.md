This video explains how to use JavaScript and JQuery to give your website some interactivity. This video series is to introduce website development for beginners who don’t know anything about making websites. This series assumes you don’t know anything about web development, but if I go beyond what you understand, ask me a question and I’ll try to get back to you as soon as possible!
