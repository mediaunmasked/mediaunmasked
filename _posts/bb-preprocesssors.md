#How To Use SASS - CSS Preprocessors Explained
---

There are many preprocessors these days and you should be including them in your workflow because they offer many things that normal css files don’t. It’s not complicated to get started using them, but you’ll need something that will process the preprocessed files into css files when you save them. Two tools that can do this are Gulp.js and Jekyll, both of which have many more benefits and you should also be using those. If you’re not sure how either of them work, go ahead and watch my tutorials I’ve made on them linked in the video description.
