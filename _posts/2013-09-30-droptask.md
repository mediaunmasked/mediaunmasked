#Drop Task – Free Visual Task Manager
---

Drop Task is a [free visual task manager](https://www.droptask.com/) that lets your share projects, prioritise them, updates statuses and more.

##Visual Task Managers

To begin, I want to mention that there is a lot of software that can help you manage projects and assign tasks to other people, but the decent or good ones do not come cheap, especially free. Others have gantt sheets that can help you maintain projects, but for those who learn better by visual (and some text), Drop Task is much more effective.

##Drop Task Features

Drop Task is a web-based program that lays out everything you need to get done; you can separate subjects into separate groups called Projects, such as school assignments and work assignments. This way, your projects aren’t interfering with each other or cluttering up your screen. If you have multiple people working on a project and you need to share the project manager, you can invite people by clicking the little add person button by your picture and invite people via email. Within each project, you can add groups to further organize your projects and groups can be placed within each other. To add tasks, it’s as simple as dragging a new task down from the top and typing what needs to be done. Each task can be given a due date, specific people to work on it, tags (to filter – further explained later), external attachments (you can access Google Drive and Drop Box or your computer), subtasks, and more features per task. The extra features include adding comments to communicate to other workers, updating the status of the task to completed, on hold, in progress, etc., and assign priority and effort to each task. The subgroups themselves can change to one of ten colors by just clicking on the rim of the group and picking a color.

##See The Big Picture
With deadlines and prioritization, each task can be seen from the big picture by using filters. With this features, project managers can see what is needing to be done and get an overall idea of how the groups is progressing on the tasks for the project. The simplistic and useful features of this software is truly amazing and I recommend it for any visual person who needs better management of their projects to get things done. It’s free for everyone; no trials and no fees. They are able to do this because they plan to release a premium version in the future.
