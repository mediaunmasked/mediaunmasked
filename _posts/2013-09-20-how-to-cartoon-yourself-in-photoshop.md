#How to Cartoon Yourself in Photoshop
---
{% include vid.html %}
When I was a young kid, I loved drawing and was decent (for my age) at it. Now that I’m older, there’s no keeping up to the pros that draw masterpiece cartoons like it’s nothing, so I installed Photoshop. With Photoshop, you can make any picture look like it was hand drawn to add a cartoon effect to any image.

##Cartoon Yourself Step-By-Step Instructions

* Open you image in Photoshop
* Press ctrl+j to duplicate the layer
* Click on the add adjustment layer button and add a Hue/Saturation layer
* Reduce the saturation to -100

* Click on the thumbnail on layer one and change the blend mode to color dodge

* Invert the image by pressing ctrl+i
* Navigate to Filter -> Blur -> Gaussian Blur

* Slide the radius to an appropriate amount that looks good and cartoonish
* The cartoon effect is nearly visible!
* Add a Levels adjustment layer and slide the input darks to the right until the face looks good

* *Note:* If the other areas are too dense, brush in (40% black) areas that are too dense
* *Note:* if the other areas are too dark, make a composite snapshot by hitting ctrl+shift+alt+e
* With white (40%) selected, paint over the dark areas.
* To clean up areas, simple brush white (100%) over odd spots
* Voila — You’ve drawn a cartoon (kinda)!
