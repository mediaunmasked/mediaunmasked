#Protect Your Computer From Viruses With FREE Antivirus

{% include vid-n.html %}

##Antiviruses Need To Be Cheap/Free, Protective, And Fast
Tired of getting the infamous [Blue Screen of Death (BSOD)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Screen_of_Death)? If you haven’t already noticed by Google’s business model, FREE is the way quality digital products are headed, powered by the people that use it. If there’s a free counterpart to a software that does the same thing (possibly even better), I try to stick with it. In the case of antivirus, most computers come with Norton or McAfee preinstalled to the system and can be annoying everytime you turn on your computer, asking you for money. From my personal perspective, I’d rather get a quality, free and up to date software such as [Microsoft Security Essentials](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security-essentials-download).

***Disclaimer:** any software I suggest in this post is from my personal experience and opinion. If you feel comfortable using a paid service, continue to do so. I’m just offering an alternative to those who don’t want to dish out the extra cash but still want a quality product.*

* Don’t click on any suspicious links
However obvious this sounds, people still do it.
A good way to check for a safe link is to see the domain it goes to when you hover your mouse over it (see below).

* If you’re downloading a file and not sure if it’s safe, send the link to Virus Total URL scanner.
* If you’ve already downloaded the file, they also offer a file scanner.
* Run regular virus (and malware) scans with Microsoft Security Essentals and Malwarebytes Anti-Malware.
* Follow this video to set up monthly reminders (open those programs once a month/week).
