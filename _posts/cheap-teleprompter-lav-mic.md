#Cheap Teleprompter & Lav Mic Setup

<h3>Cheap App &amp; Microphone Can Raise Your Production Quality</h3>
Using a nice $12 microphone (<b>Olympus ME52</b>) and an amazing app in itunes (also available for android) called <b>Teleprompter+</b>. There are free apps, sure, but there were a few features I found Teleprompter+ had that the others, even some paid, didn't.
<h4>Teleprompter+ Features</h4>
<ul>
<ul>Costs $8</ul>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>Variable speeds (to the tenth decimal)</ul>
<h4>Olympus ME-52 Overview</h4>
<ul>
<ul>Costs $12</ul>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
<ul>Short(ish) cord of XX in. - (I recommend the Azden MODELNUMBER [$$$ and has a 20 ft. cord])</ul>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>2.5 mm output (you'll either need a $1 converter [shipped], or go with the Azden - it's got the 3.5 mm output phones use)</ul>
Notes about the Azden
If you do go with this slightly more expensive mic, there are a couple things to consider. First, it requires an additional battery, which may be annoying, but keep in mind it won't affect/be affected by your device. The Azden has a longer cord, which is nice, and an unnoticeable better audio quality.
