#Amazon Smile -- Make The World Better By Shopping
---

{% include ad-post.html %}

Amazon has released [smile.amazon.com](http://smile.amazon.com/) with which they will donate 0.5% of anything you buy from their site to a charity of your choice. Amazon is all about customer satisfaction, and what’s more satisfying than giving to a charitable organization which makes the world a better place to live in. For this reason, Amazon will be paying the 0.5%; not you nor the merchants.

Amazon has always been about satisfying their customers through a great **[user experience]({% post_url 2014-06-02-user-experience-part-1 %})**. Be it their numerous and well-written reviews, great return policy, free shipping or their customer support (including the face-to-face *Mayday* feature on the Kindle), Amazon has kept to this promise.

*Side note*: They have recently changed their free shipping threshold from $25 (for over ten years) to $35 (recently). They had to implement the higher shipping threshold so they wouldn’t lose as much on the cost of shipping. If you wanted, you could look at it like this: they raised the free shipping threshold $10 to compensate for the losses in Amazon Smile. Or you could just be happy that they still offer free shipping and they’re giving 0.5% of their profits to charity (only if you start shopping on smile.amazon.com, though). Items that are eligible for the donation will have a little image in between the shipping section in the item description (see image below).

##Charities You Can Help By Shopping On Amazon

* American Red Cross
* St. Jude
* Charity: Water
* The Nature Conservancy
* DoSomething.org
* Or pick your own by searching their name, location, or keyword

*Note*: You can always change the charity you donate to under Your Account > Change Your Charity

This feature is great for those who are selfish enough to not donate but selfless enough to type in smile before amazon.com. Kidding aside, it’s an amazon front in the online shopping realm and I’m glad to see our $10 boost in the free shipping threshold is going to good use!
