##Swap Faces — Step-By-Step Instructions

* Pick two photographs where two faces are angled similarly.

* Import your photographs into Photoshop as separate documents.
* Using the wand tool (w) and the lasso tool (l), select the face that you want to be placed onto the new one.

* Press ctrl+c to copy the selected area.
* In the document of the initial face, press ctrl+v to paste the copied face.
* Use the free transform tool (ctrl+t) to scale (hold shift to keep aspect ratio) and position the face  (decrease the opacity to help line it up) to where the eyes align.

* Increase the opacity back to 100%.
* Navigate to Edit -> Puppet Warp
* Click on the sides and pupils of the eyes, center of the bridge and tip of the nose, sides of the nostrils, ends  and center of lips.

* Decrease the opacity of the top layer again.
* Align the same points with the image below.
* Increase the opacity and hit enter when you are finished.

* Using the eraser tool (e), erase the excess skin of the top layer.
* With the magic wand, select the area of the face.
* Right click and select inverse.
* Navigate to Select -> Modify -> Contract -> 5 pixels.

* Select the background layer and duplicate it (j).
* Press delete.
* Copy and hide the foreground layer (ctrl + j, then click the eyeball in the layers panel).
* Select both the foreground and background (the one with a deleted portion) and right click them in the layer menu and select merge layers.

* Navigate to Edit -> Auto-Blend Layers -> Panorama (with Seamless Tones and Colors ticked).
* Turn on the visibility for the copied foreground layer.
* Press alt and click add mask in the layer menu (this creates an inverted mask).
* Using a white brush, lightly brush around the features that you want to be visible (unaffected by Photoshop’s auto-blend layers).
* *Note*: alternately, you can blend them manually by either slowly deleting the foreground image until you get the desired look! Masks can also be helpful (to add a mask click the icon that is a rectangle with a circle inside it)
* *Also note*: You can pull off some really nice effects if you have a couple of good photographs and some time on your hands. As for mine, if you step away from your computer and squint, I would consider it a success!

##Tada!
