#Vanguard Tracker AP--284 Monopod Review
---
**TL;DR:** Great tripod that is built well, featuring twist-tighteners, a grip, and spike. I recommend buying it from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&linkCode=ur2&tag=mediunma0d-20" class="amazon">Amazon</a>, as they have the cheapest prices, quality reviews, and great customer support.

	Monopods are great for quick shooting; whether it’s a sporting event or just any event where you need a steady shot, but not that steady. In other words, they are for when you could shoot handheld, but you want a sharper shot, and they are not for long exposure shots such as night trailing, time lapse, or anything that requires a slow shutter speed. For time lapse photography, you’ll have to get a tripod. Monopods can be <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VZS2EU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000VZS2EU&linkCode=as2&tag=mediunma0d-20">as cheap as $14</a> and up from there. As with everything, there is an exponential correlation between price and quality. The Vanguard AP-284 monopod, in particular is $60. You might be asking yourself if it’s truly 4x better than the one mentioned previously that is 4x cheaper. I have owned and used both. I can attest that while it may not perform 4x as many tasks (they are both monopods), it is easily 4x better quality. My tripod is made by Vanguard and it’s lasted me many years and is still in great shape. Vanguard knows how to make camera gear, and they didn’t fail to impress.

##Key Specifications
This monopod isn’t your traditional monopod. It comes from the well-known camera gear company, Vanguard, and encompasses some key elements.

* Price — <a href="http://www.amazon.com/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&linkCode=ur2&tag=mediunma0d-20" class="amazon">$60 on Amazon</a>

* Carabiner & wrist strap
* Foam grip
* 3 x Twist to loosen
* Adjustable rubber foot (with optional spike in the bottom for terrain)

I bought this from 42photo, who I *do not* recommend. They, like many companies, offer good deals on certain products (camera bodies only, for them), and then overprice you on the others. Basically, 42photo does it to the extreme. More specifically, I had ordered something that I was more or less talked into getting and it was way overpriced, which was completely my fault. After a lot of phone calls and arguments with their customer support, I was able to refund the product for in-store credit (per their return policy). I chose to buy this monopod because I needed to buy something and this was a product that wasn’t much more expensive on their site than Amazon (it’s ~$70 on 42photo and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&linkCode=ur2&tag=mediunma0d-20" class="amazon">~$60 on Amazon</a> currently). Doing such exchange took over 20 phone calls over a span of many months (years if you don’t consider the time I didn’t spend harassing them) to get a simple exchange. Amazon would’ve fulfilled my request immediately.
