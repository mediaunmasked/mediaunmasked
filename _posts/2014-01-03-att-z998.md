#AT&T Z998 Phone Review
---
{% include vid.html %}

The Z998 is a great value for being a GoPhone and I highly recommend it, especially for mid-price entry level go phones. Its sleek and minimal design is on par with other high end phones that require costly monthly plans but you can use this phone with the prepaid phone cards (a <span class="bg-success">$25</span> card <span class="bg-warning">expires in 3 months</span>, so essentially itâ€™s <span class="bg-success">**$8.33/mo.**</span>). Running Android 4.1.2 you get up-to-date apps just like on any other smartphone. Check out the current price and reviews on <a href="http://amzn.to/1njNEO1" class="amazon">Amazon</a> to find if it fits your needs.
