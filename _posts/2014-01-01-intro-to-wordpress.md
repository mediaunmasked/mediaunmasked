#How To Create A Website In 2014 Using WordPress

{% include vid.html %}

To make a proper website, you need a host, a theme and, of course, content. I can help provide the first two. I’d recommend the theme I made and Fatcow as your web host. You can get any themes for cheap on the world wide web, and setup Fatcow in minutes following my guide. Most themes require knowledge of coding languages like HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but my theme is fully customizable through the WordPress dashboard. You won’t need to know how to code to get a nice looking site up and running. Hope it helps!
