#Vanguard SBH-250 Ball Head Review
---

{% include vid.html %}

##Overview
There are four locking twist knobs:

* One locks the panning system
* Another locks the ball head itself
* The mirrored knob fine-tunes the ball head’s sensitivity
* The last one tightens and loosens the quick release plate slider (a separate button releases the quick release plate on the SBH-250 head)

The ball head has two spirit levels, markings on the panning system and it also comes with an extra quick release plate (total of two).
