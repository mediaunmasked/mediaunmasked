#How To Enable Monetization & Link Adsense To YouTube
---

If you’ve made your first, or even a few YouTube videos, gotten them properly uploaded and what you thought properly monetized, only to find many views later you’ve earned nothing, don’t worry; you’re not alone. It’s quite easy to fix this hidden problem that I’ve come across, and it only takes a step past what you’ve probably already done.

##Google Adsense Setup

1. Click on your account in the top right side of your screen on YouTube.
2. Select “Settings”.
3. Make sure “Allow advertisements to be displayed alongside my videos” is checked.
4. On the left side under “Channel Settings, select “Features”.
5. Now click “Enable” next to “Monetization”
6. Select the blue “Enable my account”
7. “Read” the agreement and check the 3 corresponding boxes.
8. Click “I accept” and “I got it”
9. Now go to “Settings” again.
10. Select “Monetization” under the Channel Settings.
11. **You’re done, unless you already had an adsense account and want to link it to *another* channel. If this is the case:**
12. Log into the channel you want to link to Adsense.
13. Go to the Settings.
14. Select monetization.
15. Click on “How will I be paid?”
16. Click the, “associate an Adsense account” link.
17. Select “Next”.
18. Click the first button if your Adsense account is the same as your YouTube; the right if they’re different.
19. Follow the onscreen prompts, logging into your Adsense account and authorizing the channel’s association.
20. Click “Accept association” button and *voila*!
