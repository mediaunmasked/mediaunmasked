In Microsoft's reveal, the big message they wanted to convey was that this device is meant to replace your laptop and tablet. With a full Windows 8.1 operating system, the Surface Pro 3 can run any application that you would on your laptop. Microsoft hopes that the Surface Pro 3 will replace your tablet and laptop; they hope to replace your main entertainment device *and* productivity device. I respect its innovation and think it has accomplished what it has set out to do.

##Specifications
* Screen size: 12″
* Resolution: 2160 x 1440 px (3:2 aspect ratio)
* Dimensions: 11.5″ x 7.93″ x 0.3″
* Battery Life: 9 hours (internet browsing)
* Weight: 1.76lbs (800 grams)
* Storage: 64GB/128GB with 4GB RAM or 256GB/512GB with 8GB RAM
* Processor: 4th generation Intel Core i3, i5, or i7
* Ports: USB 3.0, microSD card reader, headset jack, mini DisplayPort, and a cover port (for the keyboard)
* Camera: 5.0 megapixel rear- and front-facing cameras, stereo microphones, and stereo speakers
* Sensors: Ambient light sensor, accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer
* Kickstand positions: Variable
* In the box: Surface Pro 3, Surface Pen, 36W Power supply, Quick start guide, safety warranty documents

They offer 5 different models and, as expected the middle one will probably be the most popular, but when deciding which one I was going to buy, I asked [reddit.com/r/surface](http://reddit.com/r/surface) which processor they were going to get (either the i5 or i7, both with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage). With over 200 respondents, the i5 won – partially due to the earlier ship date and the $250 price difference. I also asked about what color of keyboard they were going to get.

##Not Quite A Laptop Without A Keyboard
Microsoft has really been pushing the fact that the Surface Pro 3 will replace your laptop, but they sell it without a keyboard! I know you can use the on-screen keyboard, but to compete with any serious laptop, you need a physical keyboard, which will run you another $130. There is a few different colors you can choose from, which is nice. However, the blue touch cover is exclusive to [Best Buy](http://www.bestbuy.com/site/microsoft-surface-pro-3-type-cover-blue/6728113.p?id=1219234626759&skuId=6728113&st=surface%20pro%203&cp=1&lp=7) and the red touch cover is exclusive to [Microsoft](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=c7NIkJYZlzo&offerid=336830.10000748&subid=0&type=4).

##Get A Free Keyboard
Let's face it – it's just not a laptop without the touch cover. There are promotions Microsoft offers that can save you a lot of money, especially if you're a student. First, there is a promotion going on right now that offers 10% off products from the Microsoft store. So, if you're buying a $1300 Surface Pro 3 (the model I have), you'll get $130 off, which is the price of the keyboard. If you want any touch cover, except the blue one exclusive to Best Buy, you can also get 10% off of it. If you're not a student, you can still get 5% off by [giving your phone number to Microsoft](https://microsoftstore.promo.eprize.com/mobile/) (note: this doesn't stack with the student discount). After you sign up for that, you can stop the promotion texts by replying with "STOP". If you're wanting a wireless, bluetooth, mouse, Microsoft has made a very thin and compact mouse (that flattens) called the [Arc Touch Mouse](http://amzn.to/S7Vsb0).

##Wacom Vs. N-Trig
Charles Gbadamosi of TickTakashi [reviewed the technical aspects](http://www.ticktakashi.com/2014/05/wacom-vs-n-trig-modern-comparison.html) of this tablet in regards to the pen and the technology behind it. Initially, when the news that Wacom was no longer the tech behind Microsoft's Surface, many people seemed upset because of two reasons: N-Trig's past technology and pressure sensitivity levels. However, Charles points out the insignificance of the sensitivity number:

>When drawing with a Brush size that is lower than 256, there is no difference in sensitivity between Wacom and N-Trig. Digitizer companies use pressure levels in the same way that many tech companies use specs: they count on a lack of public understanding in order to justify expensive upgrades that are largely unnecessary. 256 vs 512 vs 1024 vs 2048 is, for the most part, just marketing.

To elaborate, he says that the pressure sensitivity of 256 is usually only important if you're using brush sizes larger than 256 (for blown up images on a billboard, for example).

To sum up the TickTakashi article, Wacom has a higher pressure sensitivity, N-Trig has a more accurate stroke accuracy, Wacom has better pen hover technology, there is a tie in stroke delay, N-Trig fixes the parallax issue invoked in Wacom tech, N-Trig doesn't require calibration, so is better in drift and calibration, and Wacom (being the industry standard) has more software support. To read his analysis of each of these categories, [read the article](http://www.ticktakashi.com/2014/05/wacom-vs-n-trig-modern-comparison.html).

Gabe, from Penny Arcade, was sent a Surface Pro 3 to [review from an artists' perspective](http://www.penny-arcade.com/news/post/2014/05/23/surface-pro-3). He seemed to appreciate the larger screen, the aspect ratio, and the pixel density and, overall, thought that it was very good for illustration. However, until he tries out the i7, he didn't want to tell artists to run out and get it; but this is just one guy's opinion, so don't take it as gospel! Choose whichever one, if any, fits your budget and needs!
