#How To Make A Frozen Ice Planet In Photoshop
---

{% include vid.html %}

In this Photoshop tutorial, I’ll be showing you how to create a frozen, icy planet floating in the middle of a remote star field and back-lit by an intense, stellar light source.

##Creating The Ice Planet In Photoshop

* Open a new document at any size that your reference file allows. The first step is to make other stars in the galaxy.
* Do this by going to Filter > Noise > Add Noise…
* Select the Gaussian radio button and the monochromatic check box.
* Add a good amount of blur (around 80%) and hit OK.

* Go to Filter > Blur > Gaussian blur… and add just a little blur (around 0.3 pixels).

* Open the levels adjustment (Ctrl + L) and change the sliders until they resemble the star field that you like.

* Open the ice image of your choice and go to filter > Distort > Spherize

* Repeat the filter by pressing Ctrl + F
* Grab the circular marquee tool (M) and make a circle around the circle you just created.
* Now separate it onto its own layer by pressing Ctrl + J.
* Hide the layer under it to reveal the space background.
* Drag it to where you’d like it positioned. In this example I’ll move it to the bottom of the screen.
* To sharpen the image, navigate to Filter > Sharpen > Unsharp Mask

* Put the amount to roughly 80% and the radius to about 3 pixels.

* To add a blue hue to the ice planet, in the layers panel, add a Hue/Saturation adjustment layer by clicking the half white/dark circle icon and selecting Hue/Saturation…
* Check off colorize and adjust the hue slider to your liking. Around 225 will make it blue.

* To add a glowing effect, double click the planet layer and check off Outer Glow and Inner Glow. For each, choose a corresponding color, but in this example I’ll use white. Now adjust the size of the glow effect with the slider and then press OK.

* Now, to add a soft glow to the top of the planet, Ctrl + click on the planet layer to select the shape.
* Using the brush tool (B), select white as your color (or other glow-related color you want) and soften the brush by right clicking anywhere on the canvas and adjusting the slider. Once fit to a decent size, click once near the top of the planet to add a glow.

* To add a shadow, make a new layer (assuming you still have the planet selected), and feather the selection by right clicking the selection (with lasso, wand or marquee tool selected) and click feather. Feather it about 50 pixels. Now, right click the selected area and choose fill > Use: black > OK.

* Deselect the area with Ctrl + D.
* Using the selection tool (V), drag the shadow down.
* Using the transform tool (T), grab a corner and, while holding Shift + Alt, drag it out a bit so it creates a rim-effect on the planet.

* Now, make a new layer above the background layer
* Using the brush tool (B), click near where you made the highlight before, but with a much larger brush size.
* To add a final touch, add a lens flare by first creating a composite snapshot of all the layers by hitting Ctrl + Shift + Alt + E.
* Now navigate to Filter > Render > Lens Flare…
* Position the lens flare how you’d like and the brightness (I put it on the planet’s rim and at 75% strength).
