#Disintegrating Disperse Or Splatter Effect In Photoshop
---

To add a bit of style to your graphic design or photograph, why not try adding a disintegrating effect? It’s very simple and doesn’t require a lot of work, through the power of Photoshop (CS6 in my case). With a few free brushes, this effect can be achieved in a few minutes!

##Disintegrating Effect -- Instructions

* Import your picture into Photoshop
* Download some free splatter brushes ([Set 1](http://myphotoshopbrushes.com/brushes/id/369/) / [Set 2](http://myphotoshopbrushes.com/brushes/id/445/)) (You can import them by dragging the file into Photoshop) or place the .arb file in C drive – program files – Adobe – Adobe Photoshop – Presets – Brushes
* Your subject needs to be separated from the background, so you need to select it (refine edge for selecting hair) and separate it from the background.

* Using the eraser tool, choose your new splatter brush (load it by right clicking) and erase the side that you want to be disintegrated (choosing different brushes helps diversify the image)

* Choose the color of an area near the edge of the subject with the eyedropper tool (i)
* Now, select the brush tool (b) and, on a new layer, click once with a splatter brush selected.
* Press ctrl+t to rotate the splatter effect to its corresponding position
* Repeat this until the entire side of the image gives you the desired look
* Merge all of the splatter layers and place it under the subject image.
