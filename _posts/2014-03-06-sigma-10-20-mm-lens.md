#Sigma 10-20mm f/4-5.6 Lens Review
---

{% include vid.html %}

##Overview
The Sigma 10-20mm f/4-5.6 lens is a great lens if you need a wide, rectilinear lens (no curvey edges or fish eye lens effect). This video is shot with it on a Canon T3i, which is a cropped-frame sensor DSLR. This particular lens opens up to f/4 at its widest angle, 10mm, and f/5.6 at 20mm. I’ve also noticed that it can take some pretty sharp close up images, which is what you might want to use it for. The field of view is about 60-100 degrees (in comparison to a 50mm’s 25 degrees on a cropped frame). It’s built nicely and Sigma’s a good name to trust when it comes to lenses. It’s on Amazon for Nikon and Canon DSLRs – <a href="http://j.mp/sigma10-20" class="amazon">http://j.mp/sigma10-20</a>
