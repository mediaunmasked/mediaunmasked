#Manage Google Drive, Dropbox, Box, etc. - MultCloud
---


Can you imagine your life without Google Drive, Dropbox or other cloud services?  They help you create and store your important documents, photos, and videos in the cloud. Most offer some free space to get started and then charge for more, so you might find yourself using different services; maybe you have the pictures on your phone backed up on dropbox, while your school papers are in Google Drive. There’s a service called Multcloud that manages all of your cloud services. You simply sign in and can search, sort, and delete files from any cloud service. All you need is one password to access all your cloud space from one site - multcloud.com. The best part is it’s free! You just have to make an account and connect each cloud service once. You can even add multiple accounts for each service, allowing for an almost unlimited amount of digital storage space. It’s free to use, all you’ve got to do is go to multcloud.com and see for yourself!
