#Bitcoin -- The Perfect Currency
---

<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Bitcoin_logo.svg" alt="" class="pull-right">
A currency is, by definition, a system of money in general use in a particular country and the fact or quality of being generally accepted or in use. Gold, silver, animals, and now the dollar (or other native currency) has been and is used as a form of trade. I’ll do/give you this for something that we, and most people, agree has value. But it’s not that simple; most forms of currency have failed for a number of reasons until only a few years ago, an open source project called Bitcoin planned to change what we’re all accustomed to.

##Bitcoin Overview Videos
Here are a few videos I found that explained the subject very well. The first two are only a few minutes long and the others go more in-depth at explaining. I highly recommend you watch some of these and educate yourself about the everchanging world we live in.

<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1pj7yq/why_i_believe_were_on_the_cusp_of_the_3rd_great/">Here’s a list of resources</a> consolidated by a fellow Redditer.
The reason I bring this to your attention is because it will affect all things, media including – how you buy, sell and interact with other people in your life online. Bitcoin is a very viable solution to many of the problems modern currencies have, but will only work if people agree they work, as with all currency.

###This perfect currency is:

* Inflation proof – only about 21 million bitcoins will ever be created (but the large decimals allow for more currency than we could imagine to utilize).
* Fraudproof – People cannot steal your wealth and with simple security, your money is safe.
* Decentralized – With peer-to-peer technology, no one person can ever have control; the network of thousands of powerful computers are used to secure the network.
* Private – Your name isn’t connected to your wallet (unless you choose to use a third party service like Coinbase – The best and most secure (they store your information offline for free, so it’s pretty simple through them) bitcoin exchange I’ve come accross.

##What’s Wrong With Dollars?
Textbooks are to blogs as letters are to email as Bitcoin is to money. It’s inevitable with mishaps like NSA security issues, fiat (values set by government) money being printed whenever wanted, fluctuating the value of the dollar every day, and other issues with failing economies. Countries where the monetary system is failing is largely adapting Bitcoin as a payment method because it solves nearly all of the problems that the government controlled monetary system created.

##Reasons Bitcoin Works

* It is NSA-proof
* It survived the death of the Silk Road (more on this below)
* It is secure – not by one person, but thousands of people together.
* It’s universal, instant and has no middleman!

##Reasons Bitcoin Doesn’t Work
Don’t get me wrong, I think it’s the best solution to the problem we have today – one we may not have known was a major problem until we found the solution. It’s like not knowing a poorly designed toothbrush until it’s in your mouth. Some criticism lies here:

* Volatility – In its young age, it shows some instability in price, but with time (to get more coins circulated) and support, stability will come.
* Security – As there is no middleman (other than third-party), payments are permanent and should only be sent to trusted people.
* However rare and inefficient, cancer nodes can be exploited, in a way. (read more about weaknesses here)

##The Silk Road Fiasco
Traditionally, Bitcoin was hot in the drug market. That is, it was the only currency accepted on the well-known “eBay for drugs and weapons,” the Silk Road – for obvious reasons. Only a few days ago from me writing this post did the Feds seize about $30 million worth of bitcoins from the owner of the Silk Road – see, even our government wants in on it! (just kidding, they most likely don’t support Bitcoin). That’s not the only place it’s being used by any means; [Online stores](https://bitdazzle.com/?r=31679), [WordPress](http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2012/11/15/pay-another-way-bitcoin/), [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/) and many more are now accepting Bitcoin. While you might think the drug bust shines a negative light on Bitcoin and removal from trade might have affected transaction rates and the health of its economy, it only hurt it the day of! If anything, it’s created awareness and had a positive spin on the economy. It also has to do with the fact that there are only a finite amount being created and when that many are removed, it creates more demand for the global currency. Hopefully I was able to inform you about something awesome that you might not have known before.
