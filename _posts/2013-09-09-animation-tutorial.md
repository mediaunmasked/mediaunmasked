#How To Make An Animation In Adobe Flash

##2D Animation

{% include vid-n.html %}

Animation has been around for many decades and it’s quite amazing what some individuals can do. It takes true talent and endurance of an artist to make the videos they do in the unique styles and disciplines they take. One individual has made learning the skill of drawing and, specifically, animation on YouTube easy and for free.

##Equipment
There are a few tools you need to make creating an animation possible. First, if you plan to make much progress, then you won’t want to be drawing frames with your mouse, so you should consider getting a Wacom tablet. Wacom is, currently, the leading company for digital drawing tablets. They range from small (~$100) to professional (~$2000+) but are definitely worth the purchase (even the $100 one; it’s what I use and it works great) if you want to do any amount of animating or similar digital arts. As for software, a wide amount of people use Adobe Flash to create their animations, as it is versatile, offering onion skin (ghost frames to help draw the next frame), the option for add-ons such as Keyframe Caddy which makes lip syncing so much easier and faster, and many more options. Another well-known 2D animation software is Toon Boom Studio. <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/wiki/creator-resources/flash-resources/swivel">Swivel</a> is a software developed and offered for free by the people at <a href="http://newgrounds.com/">newgrounds.com</a> that converts the .swf file, created by Flash, to a video file that is YouTube (and other video sites) friendly. Once you have the proper hardware and software, there’s not much left to do but start making!

##Tutorials
There are a number of tutorials offered on Newgrounds, YouTube, and other varying sites, and I encourage you to search for ones that appeal to you, but I must recommend you start by viewing <a href="http://youtube.com/drawwithjazza">Draw With Jazza</a>, on YouTube. He is a professional animator and offers his great knowledge through in-depth video tutorials on specific topics relating to animating using Adobe Flash. He posts the tutorials for free, so giving him some positive feedback would be the least you can do :).

Amongst the superb tutorials, Jazza highlights up-and-coming artists through a segment called artist showcase, in which the winner gets featured on the front page of Newgrounds, and the other 'contestants' get his advice in the video. He gives great advice and is a **HUGE** resource for current and aspiring artists. He is exactly what you were looking for on the internet (if you’re an aspiring artist/2D animator). Go make something!
