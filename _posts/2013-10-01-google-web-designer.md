#Google Web Designer Overview
---

{% include ad-post.html %}

Don’t let Google fool you! To fully disclaim this, Google Web Designer is deceiving and should be called Google Ad Designer. On September 30, 2013 they released yet another free and useful software, [Google Web Design](http://www.google.com/webdesigner/), to make the internet a better place. It’s like no other tool you’ve used to make websites, but it has the functionality of everything you need to make such websites. Currently in beta, this freeware encompasses design intended for any screen – desktop, tablet or mobile – without compatibility issues, to make the internet a better place. They also have some [great documentation](https://support.google.com/webdesigner/#topic=3249465), a help forum and their [Google Plus page](https://plus.google.com/+googlewebdesigner/posts) (for announcements) that I’m sure will grow with time.

##Google Web Designer Features

Google Web Designer was created for both designers and developers. More specifically, it was made to create advertisements for the internet. They want the user to focus on design, as we are visual creatures, and the software will make the code work as it should. However, if you know code, you can also edit it to make your site more powerful and under control. To make it clear, this software is **not an IDE for developers**. The introductory videos on their YouTube channel makes it clear that this software is targeted for ad development; in hopes to eliminate flash based ads, increase click rates and, therefore, increase Google’s revenue.

###Animation
This feature has two modes: Quick mode and Advanced. Quick mode allows you to build web animations scene by scene and the software creates the in-between frames. The Advanced mode adds complexity, but also power. In this mode, you can animate individual elements in layers and edit the element layers within the stack.

###3D Environment
The web is constantly growing in information and the way we view that information. While the early days of the internet had only text, now there is the capability of 3D in websites. Web Designer has a full 3D authoring environment which allows you to create and modify 3D and even 2D designs along any axis using the CSS3. The possibilities are unlimited!

###Illustration Tools
To create simple and basic vector-style designs, you can use the illustration tools built-in to the software or you can always import other assets from different creative suites. To add HTML, you simply drag it in with the Tag tool. This is a great alternative for small things that you’d normally have to code by hand or make in an image editing program.

###View Source Code
For anyone who has used Adobe Dreamweaver and created anything more than basic HTML, you’ll know that web designing software can’t always match the power of the code behind the scenes. While the visual tools are very helpful, they might not always be able to do everything as precise as it should be, so the source code is always viewable in Google Web Designer.

###Ad Implementation
For web developers, designers, small business owners, and anyone interested in publishing ads through any platform (not limited to Google Adwords) on your site, the software even took that into consideration. The current supported platforms areDoubleClick Studio or Admob, or even a generic option to push content through any other ad network — no code required!

##Thoughts And First Looks
So far, until better tutorials are released, check out their [official YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/GoogleWebDesigner/videos) dedicated to introducing the product to new users.

However optimistic I am, there are always going to be nay-sayers out there, and probably for good reason. A lot of people are viewing this software as more of an ad designing program, giving it the unofficial name Google ~~Web~~ Ad Designer. At the same time, there are not too many WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) tools for advertisements. People are speculating that advertisements made in this software will, hopefully, replace flash based advertising.
And I’ll leave on a less-than-optimistic view on the matter:
