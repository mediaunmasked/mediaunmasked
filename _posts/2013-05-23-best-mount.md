#Best Multi Monitor Mount (TV or Computer)
---

There are decent computer monitor mounts out there, but my current and favorite is a dual monitor mount setup. Well, there are a few qualities that give it the #1 spot, in my opinion. First, it’s not your ordinary stationary mount that *might* swivel 5 degrees, if you’re lucky. This mount will let you flip your monitor(s) vertical, horizontal and even upside down. This can be very beneficial if you have two monitors in an office as a designer so you can show your client something without them feeling the need to hover. There is minimal tightening needed to be done at the setup, but after that, your mounts are floating and will retain whatever position you shove into them. Beyond these obvious benefits, a mount that takes your computer/tv off of the desk that it was sitting on will clear up more room than you’d expect -- especially if your desk is relatively small and are used to not having much space (like mine). Mind you, I only used one monitor before I bought this mount. The two wouldn’t have fit on this desk, let alone my peripherals :).

This particular mount by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&field-brandtextbin=Ergotron&linkCode=ur2&node=172282&tag=mediunma0d-20" class="amazon">Ergotron</a> allows you to hoist your monitor in the air up to 25 in. (64 cm) with an adjustment range of 18 in. (46 cm), but it also will hold laptops (using a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ECUMTS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000ECUMTS&linkCode=as2&tag=mediunma0d-20" class="amazon">tray</a> also sold by Ergotron), digital drawing tablets (I use Wacom) and even a keyboard (which I will use in the future when I can afford a third arm).

Installing the mount to your desk (using a clamp or a screw that are both provided) is relatively easy. It will take some time to set up, but well worth it. To operate the mount, it’s as easy as moving it, and it stays! The strength of the springs can be changed using the L shaped wrench that it comes with.

The spring joints allow you to tighten them for variable monitor sizes so that it will hold down the appropriate weight without failing or springing up (***side note:*** it can hit you in the face if you’re not careful).

##Specifications

* Holding up to 40 lbs (18.1 kg) (20 lbs [9.1 kg] each monitor), this mount will find few that it can’t support. I have a 23″ computer monitor and my old TV. It supports LCD sizes of 24″ or less.
* The dimensions are 19.5 x 15.5 x 9.5 in. and the entire thing weighs 19 lbs.
* The mount rotates 360°, pans 360°, and tilts 75°.
* It has a lift of 13 in. (33 cm) but can also fold over the base to a compact position.
* Each arm gets it’s own compartment built in for cable management to avoid any tangled cables.
* Ergotron claims that it "passes Ergotron’s 10,000-cycle motion test, which ensures a minimum of five years trouble-free height adjustment", so you know it’s built well.

Compared to what is on the market, this was when I bought it, and still is the best I could find for what I was looking for. Other mounts just aren’t as sturdy and of the quality that Ergotron has put into this mount (and I’m sure their other ones are great too!). The packaging was very nice and the individual pieces that assist the assembly are all included in the box. The actual mount is made of very durable polished aluminum that is quite sturdy. If I haven’t at least sparked interest, or you’re still searching for more information or a different perspective, check out the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ergotron-Lx-Dual-Stacking-Arm/product-reviews/B0036RDOT8" class="amazon">reviews on Amazon</a>.

Once you have two, you’ll probably want three later on (as crazy as that sounds). Speaking of crazy, here is an example of the position you can put them in. Waste of money? I think not.
