#Neewer Battery Grip Review
---
{% include vid.html %}

The <a href="http://amzn.to/1l3TLWx" class="amazon">Neewer camera grip</a> gives you the extra bulk, if your hands are big, but also an extra bulk to the battery life. There is an added area for two li-po (that go in your camera) batteries or, alternatively, 6 AAs, which you can find useful when you’re stuck somewhere and forgot your camera charger. I found it a bit awkward to focus my 50mm lens with the grip on, so it might not be ideal if you’re shooting video with a small lens and need a good hand on the focus ring. But the double battery life is always a win!

You can get off-brand batteries for as low as 2 for $10 on <a href="http://amzn.to/1elOQjf" class="amazon">Amazon</a>.
