#How To Make Logo Using Negative & Positive Space

{% include vid.html %}

This is a tutorial for making a simple, but striking, black & white logo using the negative and positive shapes of letters. This effect will look nicer with curved letters

##Step-By-Step
This technique works well with an odd number of characters. Start out by dragging down a ruler. You do this by clicking on the top area of your screen with the numbers and dragging down. If you don’t see the rulers, you can turn them on by going to View > Rulers or pressing Ctrl + R. Also while there, make sure the snap to grid function is on (View > Snap).

Now you can make your letters. I’ll be using the word “MEDIA” in this example. Start with the first letter. Make it once and then copy it 5 times, placing each by another all aligned to the ruler you dragged down before. After you’ve made the first one, you can hold Alt and click to create a copy and Shift to ensure the letter stays on the grid relative to the first letter.

Now, create a new layer under these and change the color to something not what your letters are by using the paint bucket tool (G). In this case, I’ll use grey. Using the text tool (T), select the other letters and change them to be what you want. Also, change every other letter to white (or colors you want).

Using the move tool, drag all of the letters beside each other until they snap to the edges of the other letters.

Select the area of the word with the marquee tool (M) and then use the brush tool to color in alternate spaces, such as in the example below.

Now navigate to Select > Color Range > Highlights > Ok.

Now delete this selection and hide the background color.

You can further modify this logo by transforming it, for example. To do this, select the transform tool (T) with the logo layer selected and drag it to your liking.

From here, we can add a drop shadow. To do this, duplicate the layer with Ctrl+J and then you’ll want to flip it vertically by selecting the free transform tool (T) again. Right click the logo and select Flip Vertical.

Duplicate the shadow layer by selecting it and pressing Ctrl + J. Now position it in a nice shadow-esque position and add a gaussian blur by going to Filter > Blur > Gaussian blur… and make it 2 or 3 pixels.

On the shadow layer that you didn’t add the gaussian blur to, add a mask by clicking the rectangle-with-a-circle-inside icon in the layers panel. Also make sure it is on top of the blurred layer. Grab the gradient tool (G) and select a black and white gradient and add it to the mask. You can select the mask via the layer panel. Make the gradient appear in a way that gives the shadow a more realistic effect. From here, slide the opacity down for both shadow layers that will give it a faded look. You can continue to edit your logo or get ideas from the video. Have fun!
