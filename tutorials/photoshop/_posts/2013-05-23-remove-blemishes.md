##Remove Almost Anything

It’s quite simple to remove an unwanted blemish from your face. Just import your photo into Photoshop and select the spot healing brush (j). It’s as simple as brushing over the areas that you don’t want to be in the photo. The software uses the data (the photo) around the area you’re trying to "spot heal," in order to determine what to replace the area with. Keep in mind there are more than just the brush. If you click and hold over the spot healing brush, you can select the patch tool that lets you select an area and move it somewhere. Photoshop will attempt to make the move, erase, and blend it to the best of its capability. The content-aware move tool will do a similar effect, but try to keep the object in contact. There is also a red-eye removal tool that I try to avoid -- it appears to only darken the red area that you brush over; essentially just desaturating the area.

The spot healing brush tool works very well on pimples and facial blemishes, but can cause some issues when trying to remove large objects from a picture that doesn’t contain an abundance of extra data around the object you’re trying to remove. Make sure you’re only trying to heal the area you want removed (don’t brush too much around the area). If you are trying to remove something other than a small blemish from a face, try selecting the area with the quick selection tool (w) and select it more precisely with the lasso tool (l), then right click the selected area and hit "Fill…" Choose "Content-Aware" under the "Use:" area and hit "OK." This will do a very similar effect — try to remove the selected area, in relation to the content surrounding it.
