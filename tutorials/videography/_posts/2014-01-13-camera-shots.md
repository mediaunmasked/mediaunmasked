Media aesthetics are made in a creative sense to achieve an effect or to create a perception. In terms of semiotics, there are different signs that can influence how people perceive things in media. You can achieve some of these through the use of camera shots and movements.

##Camera Shots, Examples & Their Meanings
Every camera position you see in a movie or TV show is usually accounted for -- even in *The Office*. Although somewhat ambiguous in *The Office*, the camera angle and position mean a lot to a story. Having it act as a person or as a fly on the wall, it usually has meaning. The following is a list of major camera shots, an example of each and what it means.

1. **Establishing shot** -- Large overview -- Establishes location
2. **Close-up** -- Head & shoulders -- Intimacy
3. **Extreme close-up** -- Part of face -- Inspection
4. **Medium shot** -- Head & torso -- Personal relations
5. **Full shot** -- Complete body -- Social ambiance
6. **Long shot** -- Setting & people -- Context/scope
7. **Extreme long-shot** -- Person in wider context -- Orientation
8. **Z-axis** -- Vertical action from screen -- Involvement

##Camera Movements & Their Meanings
The different movements also helps the audience perceiver the scene in a specific way. Below is a list of common camera movements and what each of them mean in relation to the context of a movie or story being told on video.

1. **Pan down** -- Power & authority
2. **Pan up** -- Weakness, smallness
3. **Dollies** in -- Interest/observation
4. **Dollies** out -- Scope/context
5. **Zoom in** -- Detail/focus

These movements and camera shots are what the film industry has deemed the norm for each definition, but by no means are they limited to the definition given above. These techniques can still be altered to best suite your scene, but they can at least set a standard for the average viewer and can add to the emotion you are trying to convey.
