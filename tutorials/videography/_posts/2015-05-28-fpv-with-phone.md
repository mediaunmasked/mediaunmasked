#FPV With Your Phone, Cardboard, and $150
---

##Introduction

We live in a fantastic time (compared to the past, not the future), and part of what makes 2015 so great is the ability to pilot an aircraft the size of a tarantula for under <a href="http://amzn.to/1Ayrh20" class="amazon">$50</a>. One of the fastest growing areas of technology is "drones," or RC helicopters. They, and other RC vehicles, have been around for many years, but have recently grown in popularity with the combined implementation of affordability, ease-ability, and on-board cameras for filming or first-person-view flight. Although I've had my fair share of RC as a child, these introductions also piqued my interest as an adult. So, my Dad and I built a couple of crude tricopters and slapped a GoPro on it and became one of the other millions of people to upload their shaky footage to YouTube.

While getting a bird's eye view of your house is fun, I began to further explore the idea of flying with a live video feed like I've seen other people do. I later bought a pair of <a href="http://amzn.to/1EavyU2" class="amazon">Fatshark FPV</a> video goggles that basically act as a monitor (attached to your face) with a dedicated location for proprietary video receiver and head-tracking modules â€” neat, huh?

##Gear & App

{% include ad-post.html %}

Today, technology is rampant and the amount of different phones and drones is staggering. Phones range from $20 to $700+ and all offer similar*ish* features. The same can be said about RC multirotor helicopters, but they seem to be dropping in price much faster than phones. Regardless, to get a decent setup, you can easily spend upwards of $1000+ to get in the sky. Or not. Since phones are basically a tiny display, why not use it to fly a quadcopter? Here's a list of items, software, etc. I'll be using to get FPV on a phone.

* Android phone with <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.homesoft.otgtroubshooter&hl=en">OTG support</a> ($0)
* <a href="http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__72581__Aomway_Mini_600TVL_FPV_Tuned_CMOS_Camera_with_Microphone_and_shielded_cable_NTSC_.html">Video camera</a> ($15 or use a pre-owned camera like a GoPro)
* <a href="http://laserbgc.com/index.php?route=product/product&path=67&product_id=75">Video receiver module</a> ($44)
* <a href="http://laserbgc.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=82">Video receiver USB module</a> ($50)
* <a href="http://www.readymaderc.com/store/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=1017">Video transmitter</a> (~$50)
* <a href="http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__7308__Rhino_610mAh_3S_11_1v_20C_Lipoly_Pack.html">Battery for transmitter</a> ($5)
* Li-Po battery charger + safety bag
* <a href="http://amzn.to/1HwM5El" class="amazon">OTG cable</a> ($1.50)
* <a href="http://amzn.to/1HwLYZl" class="amazon">Cardboard</a> ($5)
* <a href="http://amzn.to/1HwMgze" class="amazon">Fatshark diopter corrective lenses</a> ($25)
* <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vaultmicro.camerafi&hl=en">CameraFi</a> ($0)
* RC vehicle of your choice

###Transmitter

Make sure the video transmitter and receiver you get run on the same frequency. In this example, you'll need to get a Fatshark-fitted module to fit on the USB module. I use the 1.3GHz bandwidth so it penetrates objects and allows for a good distance. Also, ensure that you have the right voltage battery for the job. 11.1V (3 cell) is common.

First, make sure the video transmitter has an antenna on it before proceeding. I've heard it can fry the insides if it doesn't have one on the transmitter. Not including an antenna on the receiver is okay, but its effectiveness is reduced. Simply plug in the battery to the video transmitter and it should be on. These things can get warm, so when you place it on a vehicle, be sure to allow for some air flow.

Finally, connect the battery to the transmitter and the transmitter to the video output port on the camera.

###Receiver

From here, just plug the USB module into your phone with the OTG cable and open the CameraFi (or similar) app.

Tada! Now you have an external monitor that you can use to fly FPV or control an on-board camera. Ideally, we can strap it to our heads so the sun doesn't glare and obtrude our view.

##Cardboard

Luckily, Google implemented some free plans so anyone can turn their phone into a (virtual reality) headset! With the help of Chinese manufacturers and free shipping, you can get a precut kit with the magnet, eye pieces, and other required parts on ebay or amazon. <a href="http://www.google.com/get/cardboard">Google Cardboard</a> won't be very useful right now, since I don't think there's an app that takes a "webcam" video and doubles the image for use with cardboard. When it is created, you'll be able to plug in the receiver into your phone that's being held in Google Cardboard. Unfortunately, I haven't found an app that enables side-by-side video from a webcam, so you only get monoscopic viewing for now.

##Conclusion

Nothing particularly new or revolutionary, but by using your phone and cardboard, you're saving $300+ that would have been spent on a dedicated set of video goggles. I'm pretty sure the latency is comparable; it is certainly responsive enough to be able to fly with. But your phone can also call, text, game (virtual reality), etc.
