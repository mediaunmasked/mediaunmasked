Dynamic typography, sometimes known as kinetic typography, can add a nice effect to a speech, lecture, or voice over that needs visual enhancements.Have you ever seen videos like this? How they do it is quite simple but also very tedious. You should first start out with the audio clip and the script in a text file or similar word processing file (or write the words on a document). You can start the process in Adobe After Effects, Illustrator, Photoshop or any related software to design your text layout.

##Dynamic/Kinetic Typography
In the example above, I just created it all in Adobe After Effects. Begin with the text tool (ctrl + t) and start creating new layers for each word (or groups of words, if you’d prefer them pop up in chunks rather than individual words). As you can imagine, this is very tedious, based on how many words are in your file. You might choose to do this scene by scene, depending on how many words you’re working with. Once the words are layered out in the order they appear, you will now want to determine when they are said and create the in point for that layer at that point. For example, if the first word is spoken at 00:05, then you’ll want to hit the left bracket ([) key with the cursor line at 00:05 to indicate its in-point so it pops up at that point. Once you’ve finished that part, the last thing to do is to design the layout of the words. In my example above, I made the words fill up the screen in a blocky manner, but this part is open to creativity so anything goes! Don’t be afraid to add images to your dynamic typography – they can add a very appealing style to the video. I’ve seen very creative motion graphics that people have done — the one I made (above) isn’t as creative as it could have been, but most of my time creating it was dedicated to the words. It’s common to create a dynamic typography video for a famous speech, words of encouragement, or educational videos.
