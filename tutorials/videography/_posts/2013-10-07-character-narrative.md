#Characters And Actions In The Folk Tale Narrative Structure
---

{% include ad-post.html %}

[Vladimir Propp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Propp), a Russian scholar, analyzed basic plot components of 100 Russian folk tales and created a simplified list of their narrative elements to the structure.

##Functions
Propp had identified 31 actions that characters do in a narrative that he defined as functions. I will be shortening the descriptions; for a more wordy description of each, [check out the wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Propp).

1. **Absentation**: Member of a family (hero or family member hero will later rescue) leaves the secure home environment
2. **Interdiction**: Hero is warned against some action (i.e. “don’t go there” or “don’t do this”)
3. **Violation of Interdiction**: Villain enters story (not necessarily through confrontation – perhaps a lurking presence or attack the family while hero is away)
4. **Reconnaissance**: Villain, often in disguise, attempts to get information
5. **Delivery**: Villain gains some information about the victim or hero
6. **Trickery**: Villain tries to deceive the victim or hero by using the information gained
7. **Complicity**: Victim or hero is deceived and inadvertently helped the villain
8. **Villainy or Lack**: Villain causes harm to family member, or member of family lacks something or desires something
9. **Mediation**: Misfortune is made known and the hero hears the call for help and is dispatched
10. **Counteraction**: Hero agrees to retaliate
11. **Departure**: Hero leaves home
12. **First Donor Function**: Hero is attacked or otherwise tested in preparation for a magical helper
13. **Hero’s Reaction**: Hero reacts to future helper (withstands/fails test, reconciles disputants, frees captives, etc.)
14. **Receipt of a Magical Agent**: Hero acquires use of magical agent (transferred, located, purchased, etc.)
15. **Guidance**: Hero is delivered or led to whereabouts of an object of the search
16. **Struggle**: Hero and villain engage in direct combat
17. **Branding**: Hero is wounded/marked (i.e. Harry Potter)
18. **Victory**: Villain is defeated
19. **Liquidation**: Initial misfortune or lack is resolved
20. **Return**: Hero returns
21. **Pursuit**: Hero is chased (pursuer tries to kill, eat, undermine hero)
22. **Rescue**: Hero is rescued from chase (obstacles, hero hides, etc.)
23. **Unrecognized Arrival**: Hero arrives home unrecognized
24. **Unfounded Claims**: False hero presents unfounded claims
25. **Difficult Task**: Difficult task proposed by hero (i.e. riddles, test of strength/endurance, etc.)
26. **Solution**: Task is resolved
27. **Recognition**: Hero is recognized
28. **Exposure**: False hero is exposed
29. **Transfiguration**: Hero is given a new appearance (is made whole, handsome, new clothes, etc.)
30. **Punishment**: Villain is punished
31. **Wedding**: Hero marries and ascends the throne (i.e. rewarded/promoted)

##Character Functions
Propp also concluded that all the characters could be resolved into 7 broad functions.

1. **Villain**: Struggles against the hero
2. **Dispatcher**: Character who makes the lack known and sends hero off
3. **Magical helper**: Helps hero in quest
4. **Princess or prize**: Hero deserves her but is unable to marry due to an unfair evil
5. **Donor**: Prepares the hero
6. **Hero**: Reacts to donor
7. **False hero**: takes credit for hero’s actions
