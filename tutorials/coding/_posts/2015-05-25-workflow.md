# 2015 Workflow
---

## Introduction

I’m always interested to hear *how* people do what they do. Since I’m very lazy, I strive to reach optimal efficiency when doing whatever it is I’m doing. For example, when I take a class I don’t like or find beneficial, I try to find the minimum amount of effort that’s required *to succeed*. The last bit, success, is important to note: I’m not particularly a slacker, but rather, I want to do well with minimum effort. I think a person’s work ethic in school can be transferred to their professional work ethic in a similar way. Sure, people will put forth more effort in something they care about, but they *generally* go about a task with a similar mentality. Hopefully the tools and methods I used can help improve your workflow and encourage you to be a little more productive.

## Tools

I would consider the crux of a workflow to be the tools. As a developer and although you can write 'code' in notepad, there are a few pieces of software I use to improve my process. Specifically: Sublime Text 3 (with awesome plugins), Cmder, and simple software for writing or taking notes, like Google Drive.

#### OneNote

I absolutely love my [Surface Pro 3](http://mediaunmasked.com/reviews/computer/surface-pro-3-review/). The pen has a button on top that, when pressed, opens OneNote, where you can draw and write notes relatively quickly. This is where I like to spend initial wireframing, sketching, or note taking. It takes some getting used to writing on a glossy screen, but it can be more convenient when you don’t have paper around.

#### Google Docs

Yep – pretty simple. I’m writing this in a Google Docs file because it saves on every keystroke and has most features you’d find in other word processing programs.

Taking notes in OneNote and writing in Google Docs are less important than the next few recommended software. Notes and words can be written in whichever program you prefer (or simply on paper). As time progresses, we are seeing many more text editors and improved software develop, but I, at the time of writing this, recommend Sublime Text since it’s been around for a while and has many plugins already developed and Cmder because of its minimal interface and the fact that it just works.

#### Cmder

[Cmder](http://gooseberrycreative.com/cmder/) is portable console emulator, or command line interface, for Windows that gives you the functionality similar to [Msysgit](https://msysgit.github.io/) and other operating system CLIs. I don’t have much experience with the command line, but this one does all I need it to and functions as expected. It’s got a minimal design and can be customized to include other programs, have aliases, and more.

#### Sublime Text 3 (in Cmder)

If you aren’t aware of [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/), it’s a simple and fast text editor that is extendable with plugins created by other developers. As I mentioned, there are other text editors gaining traction such as [Atom](https://atom.io/) and [Brackets](http://brackets.io/), but I’m familiar and happy with Sublime Text, so I’ll continue to use it, for now.

One great thing about Cmder is the portability. Put it on a flash drive and you can work on your projects on any other Windows computer. You can also have to option of running certain programs through it.

Sublime Text is extendable with plugins. To install plugins, you’ll first need to [install Package Manager](https://packagecontrol.io/installation). Package Manager gives you an interface in the program to simply install other plugins. Here are a few plugins I highly recommend:

##### Emmet

[Emmet](http://emmet.io/), previously known as Zen Coding, is my personal favorite workflow plugin. It speeds up your workflow when you type short phrases or symbols and hit tab to create the piece of code you wanted. A basic example would be `nav>ul>li*5[tab]` to create:

`<nav>
	<ul>
		<li></li>
		<li></li>
		<li></li>
		<li></li>
		<li></li>
	</ul>
</nav>`

Another quick trick is type `lorem50` to create a snippet of 50 lorem ipsum words. Checkout the [cheat sheet documentation](http://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/) to learn more about Emmet.

##### BufferScroll (Sublime Text 3 only)

[BufferScroll](https://github.com/titoBouzout/BufferScroll) remembers minimized or folded blocks of code, which comes in handy when you have thousands of lines of code. It also saves and restores scroll position, bookmarsk, marks, and cursors.

##### Color Highlighter

[Color Highlighter](https://github.com/Monnoroch/ColorHighlighter) will show an underline under any hex value or color in your files (usually CSS). When your cursor is on the color, the entire hex gets the background color, or you can add the following to the User preferences for the plugin:

`{

	"ha_style": "filled"

}`

##### LiveReload

[LiveReload](http://livereload.com/) is a very handy plugin that removes the constant refreshing from your workflow. You need to install the browser plugin to get it to work nicely with Sublime Text. It can be a little finicky sometimes, so if you can’t get it up and running, BrowserSync will likely solve your problems.

##### BrowserSync

[BrowserSync](http://www.browsersync.io/) greatly improves workflow for cross-device development by refreshes all of your connected devices when you save your project. It’s a command line tool that needs to be running in the background to watch for file changes. Check out their [introduction video](http://www.browsersync.io) to learn how to use it.

##### BracketHighlighter

[BracketHighlighter](https://github.com/facelessuser/BracketHighlighter) puts icons to the left of your code informing you of the opening and closing brackets where your cursor is currently. It’s simple, non-intrusive and can be helpful in navigating your code. It’s similar to the next plugin – GitGutter.

##### GitGutter

[GitGutter](https://github.com/jisaacks/GitGutter) is used in tandem with [Git](https://git-scm.com/), a version control software (more below). GitGutter is a plugin that gives you a little heads-up to the left of your code if you have changed, added, or removed code from your latest commit. This can be handy when working with other people on code or by yourself and you want to know what hasn’t been committed yet. It’s not intrusive and it gives you more information about your code, so I recommend checking it out!

#### Git + GitHub

Git is a way to save, compare, or revert code with ease. It can be confusing to learn initially, but if you plan on working with others, it is worth learning. Check out [github’s introduction to Git](https://try.github.io) to learn the basics. Once you understand the concepts of version control, you might want to *push* some of your code to [GitHub](https://github.com/). GitHub is a site where people can download, modify, and then request it to be part of the main code. It’s Facebook for code. If you plan on working with other people or *do* work with other people, knowing Git(Hub) is a valuable tool for sharing and collaborating. If you’re looking for free private repositories, there’s also [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/). GitHub is more popular for storing open source.

## Conclusion

Keep it simple. I write notes, outlines, wireframes, etc. as quickly as possible. Then, using the portable Cmder and Sublime Text, I can start development. Use what’s necessary to accomplish your goals and do what works for you. I hope my toolset workflow helps you have a more efficient and enjoyable time writing code. Thanks for reading!
