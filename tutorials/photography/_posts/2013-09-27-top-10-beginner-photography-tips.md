#Top 10 Beginner Photography Tips
---

{% include ad-post.html %}

There are many different techniques and equipment that can make you a better photographer. In this post I’ll go over what I think are the top 10 tips and tricks for beginning photographers.

##1. Compositing The Scene

The rule of thirds is your friend in photography and when shooting video. If you’ve never heard of it, it’s a guideline for compositing your photograph by aligning your subject with a third of your screen. Positioning your subject in either one third from the left or right of the screen creates a more interesting composition than if your subject was directly in the middle of the frame. For full headshots, positioning the person’s eyes in the top one third creates a similar effect. Keep in mind, these are only guidelines and composition is important in taking a great photograph.

##2. Utilizes Your Light

<img class="pull-left thumbnail" src="http://i.imgur.com/otxQIon.jpg" alt="">
The best light you can get in any photograph is free and abundant for most of the day — sunlight. While the sun provides great light, there are also some variables that come along with it. The amount and types of clouds present, the time of day, and your location can all be factors. If it is midday and the sun is making harsh shadows, you can always use a reflector (even a large white board will work). The smaller and more compact a light source is, the harsher the shadows it will create on your subject. If the light source is spread throughout a wider area by adding a diffuser (such as a white sheet, clouds or more bulbs), the shadows on your subject will be softer. Light is measured in Kelvin because it represents to color of temperature. To imitate sunlight, 5500K-6000K is the best Kelvin to look for in a light. Light is everything is photography and if the clouds are covering the sun, use it to your advantage. Clouds act as a natural diffusion box for the best light in the world. When the sun is directly above you, it can be hard to have non-squinting subjects without the harsh light. For this reason, shooting the first and last hour of complete sunlight is the best time of day to shoot. These hours are called the *golden hours* by photographers. Not only is the light diffused, it also adds atmospheric color, contrast, and gives life to small details that may not be visible in the main part of the day.

##3. Custom White Balance

Most incandescent light bulbs will create a warm (more orange) light versus the light outside, which appears to illuminate a blue color. Usually, auto white balance will compensate appropriately, but sometimes it won’t give you the right color you’re looking for, so you can choose a preset in your camera settings, or choose a custom value if you have [Magic Lantern](http://magiclantern.fm). What your camera sees as white can also be set to custom by simply taking a picture of something that should be white (as simple as a piece of white paper) and selecting it in the settings. Although an off white balance can appear to ruin your image, it’s possible to correct the color in post processing software such as Photoshop or GIMP.

##4. Zoom To Focus

While framing your shot is quite important, focusing the shot is detrimental. A blurry subject (unless, rarely, desired) ruins a photo. When autofocus isn’t on and focusing is difficult, try zooming in once or twice (digital zoom, that is) to ease the focusing process. Not every photograph you take will be in focus, that is why it is important to take many photographs, and constantly check you focus, which can be hard to see on that small LCD screen (and sometimes even more so in the viewfinder).

##5. Photography Shooting Modes

Pets are often a subject of photography, because they can be so cute. If you want to take some great shots like ones you see on the internet, it’s all about in-the-moment shots. For this reason, it’s best to shoot in burst mode. If you’re looking to keep a specific depth-of-field, Canon DSLRs offer a dial mode called AV that prioritises your custom aperture. The opposite, TV mode, will prioritise the shutter speed. You can focus on the priority mode while the camera compensates the other setting to make a decently exposed shot. This is a great alternative to the manual mode for when you either don’t have time during the event, or you just don’t trust yourself enough to properly expose the image with all settings in your hands. If you are prepared to take the responsibility to go full manual, it can be worth the effort. Manual mode lets you control the aperture, shutter, ISO, and every setting in your camera to create your desired result. Manual mode can take some time to get used to, but it is the best option if you have the time and skills to perfect your images.

##6. Aperture Optimization

The aperture size controls how much light gets into the camera, as well as the depth of field. When taking photographs, a wide aperture can be okay when wanting a small area of focus and a lot of light, but avoid using a wider aperture just to compensate for lighting situations. When taking **portraits**, having a shallow depth of field, or wide aperture, is great because it forces focus onto the model and less on the background. In contrast, when taking **landscape** photos, or similar wide subject matter, try using a narrow aperture to avoid blurring any amount of the scene. Portrait and landscape photography can be simple, in that, the subjects are static. If you’re shooting weddings or other dynamic events, f/8 is widely known to be a good mix between light allowance and depth-of-field. Exposure is highly important in any photograph to establish the environment.

##7. Tripods & Monopods

Tripods are great for many purposes, but the main purpose is to, quite simple, reduce your wobbly, shaky hands. Nighttime city photography can benefit from tripods and long exposures to create a cool effect. The shutter speed can allow for more light if you use a tripod as to reduce the would-be shakes. Monopods are used where tripods can’t go or where you just don’t feel like lugging around the bigger. A monopod is simply just a stick that screws into your camera that you can rest it on when taking photographs or video. They are prominent in sports photography because they are mobile and still very beneficial. Monopods can also be used to capture selfies when on vacation to capture the moment.

##8. Flash

Flash photography can do wonders to your image, but it can also bring about some issues if done incorrectly. It has the potential to overexpose areas of your image, create harsh shadows, and make what would be a great image look bad.

##9. Filters

When I bought my first DSLR and lens (50mm), I bought with it some basic, cheap lens filters that can help the look of my images. The ø symbol on lenses signify the diameter of the screw mount for filters or hoods. A highly recommended lens filter is a circular polariser — this lens filter adds a vibrant and contrasting blue tone and reduces reflections and glare in your shots. It creates a cool effect on water and shooting through windows. When a filter is on your lens, you need to change your white balance to avoid the camera compensating for the filter on it. While filters can be a great asset to your photography, try to avoid stacking too many, as each filter reduces the amount of light passing through by a small amount.

##10. Post Processing

Adjusting contrast, vibrance, and many other little details can make or break a photograph. In today’s world, it is almost necessary to run each photograph through some sort of post processing  such as Photoshop or GIMP to make each image pop. Whether you’re creating a graphic image or just a normal portrait, removing blemishes (if desired), adding vibrance, and weight loss has never been easier.

##Conclusion

Pay attention to your composition — it is the first thing you should think of when taking a photograph. Make sure important settings are accurate and precise to the results you want — aperture, shutter, ISO, white balance, and most importantly, focus. While manual mode is the most flexible shooting mode, the other modes can be very beneficial and a lot of pros use them. Tripods, flash, filters, and other peripheral hardware can be a great asset to the overall product, but don’t let it limit you. Finally, Photoshop is a great invention and needs to be used to touch up, adjust, and improve your photograph. Choose different points of view, change settings to reflect your idea, and create something awesome!
