#How To Make A Slideshow For School
---

{% include ad-post.html %}

If you're still using [Microsoft Powerpoint](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/powerpoint) for your presentations, you're doing it wrong! It isn't 2007 anymore, so I'm here to tell you how to make very professional looking slideshows for your school (or work) presentations. Also, it's free, much faster, failsafe (automatically saves after each change [requires internet]) and it’s **FREE**!

The secret sauce is, as always, made by [Google](http://google.com/).

##Google Drive
Amazing. Exactly what you need when putting together a presentation – RESEARCH! On the right side of the screen, you can search for scholarly information to add to your slideshow, images that can be dragged to the presentation, videos, quotes, books on the topic and even a dictionary resource. Every feature you’d ever need from any other slideshow software is available in [Google Drive](http://drive.google.com/).

##Technique To Impress
Less is more -- minimalism is the key to impressing your audience. Remember, the slideshow is only a visual aid and should not be the center of attention. YOU are the presenter and the slideshow is only a place for other people’s eyes to go to help them understand what you’re telling them. Slideshow presentations are meant to show to key points for a topic. If you have the option to pick a subject of your choice, try to choose something that you already know about or are interested in learning more about. If you’re bored with the content, your audience will be too. Usually, you’re either trying to persuade or inform people about a particular subject, so enthusiasm is a big plus. Avoid the copy and paste method so you don’t get a big ol’ F for plagiarism. It’s a good idea to have a separate document that you’ve written out what is in the slideshow (and have a good understanding of what you’re going to say) so you’re not looking at the screen the whole time. At the end of every presentation, it’s a good idea to add another slide showing where you got your information.

##Why Microsoft Office Sucks

It lead the revolution of spreadsheets ten years ago and Microsoft was successful in distributing the software, but it’s 2013 now and it’s time to stop paying for the new version, and go with something free and reliable. It is cheap, but it still costs money. Google Drive and [Open Office](https://openoffice.org/) are free, fast, compatible and very similar to [Microsoft’s software](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/products/office-products-FX101825692.aspx?CTT=97). Google Drive saves after each keystroke (or so) which makes it failsafe. You can always download a Microsoft compatible file and other file extensions.

If you don’t own Microsoft Powerpoint (or even if you do) and you don’t have a reliable internet access, I recommend using Open Office.

* The roots of Apache Open Office go back twenty years, creating a mature and powerful product
* Many millions of users
* With a fully open development process, Apache OpenOffice has nothing to hide – the product stands or falls on its reputation
* The software looks and feels familiar and is instantly usable by anyone who has used a competitive product [such as Microsoft Word]
* It’s easy to change to Apache OpenOffice – the software reads all major competitors' files
