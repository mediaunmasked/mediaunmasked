#User Experience - Consistency, Familiarity, Recognition, Prevent Error
---
{% include vid-n.html %}

Design should be something that encourages a better experience for those involved. It's the combination of the visual and technical in a harmonious relationship. The name of this process is user experience, which means "the overall experience of a person using a product such as a website," or anything else, really. Because many hours are spent every day by people around the world on the internet, I think it's important to talk about what constitutes a good user experience and why it's so important to think about.

##The Spectrum of User Experience
I found this amazing infographic a while ago and I thought it eloquently defined each sector of user experience. From business to technology to design, it graphs out the importance and overlapping areas of interest in usability of a website or other product. It's a nice introduction to UX and is interesting to review.

##The Problem
Andrew Price, a Blender expert who makes [Blender Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOKHwx1VCdgnxwbjyb9Iu1g) on YouTube, discussed in his videos (below) the major usability problems associated with Blender, a 3D modelling software, and I think any person who makes things can learn from what he has to say. He discusses the importance design has on the community - the potential turn-off a bad user experience can be (yes, I'm looking at you, pop-up windows!) From a content perspective (consuming or creating), anything that intrudes the content isn't necessary and shouldn't be there. Sure, you'll get in front of the viewer's eyes, but you might also be creating a bad first impression. It's pretty clear, by looking at the popularity of search engines, that the one(s) that optimize for their purpose have come out on top. If you add intrusivity, you're just adding unnecessary noise that will have a negative effect on the consumers. Price says he initially discredited the sceptics of the design as being lazy and not wanting to learn the software, but now he sometimes finds himself lost in the interface (after using it for 10+ years). As always, tools are made to help get a specific task done; the tools that completes the task with minimal obstruction will come out on top.

##Userbase & Community
The most popular software will always have the largest user base in our online, global market. The more users there are, the more experienced developers there are, especially on open source software like Blender. Price exemplifies the benefits of a large user base with 3DS Max. They have plugins that anyone can develop to better the software extraordinarily. The same can be said for open source extensions (in web browsers) or apps (for devices). The more, the merrier!

##History of User Interfaces (UI)
Price gives a great explanation of the history of UI in the first video (below) at around the 3 minute mark. He basically explains that the first decent way to interact with a computer was with the command line interface. However, this wasn't very user-friendly and, therefore, limited who could interact with a computer to only those who memorized the long strings of code that told the computer what to do. Next came the graphical user interface, which allowed people to user a mouse and interact with the computer more easily. Because it removed the hinderance of the tool and allowed people to use the tool to accomplish their goal, it was adopted by Microsoft and Apple for their operating systems and now, well, here we are!
Now, it's all about optimizing the user interface to enable the user to connect with their work or entertainment with less burden.

>Bottom line: user-interface design guidelines are based on human psychology.

In the first video (~5 minute mark), Price shows the amazingly consistent usability standards that were created in different locations at around the same time, without knowledge of the other. Jeff Johnson writes, in <a href="http://amzn.to/1oTiNcc" class="amazon book">Designing with the Mind in Mind</a>, that " … design rules are based on human psychology: how people perceive, learn, reason, remember, and convert intentions into action."

##Consistency
"The more consistent the operation of different functions, the less users have to learn," according to Johnson. This is the core of designing software or a website. Users shouldn't have to think about the medium or tool that they are using to get their desired end result. Consistency reduces the learning curve. For example, nearly all programs share similar shortcut key bindings with other programs and even an operating system, such as ctrl+x to cut, ctrl+c to copy, ctrp+v to paste, and so on. YouTube has even adopted a few common shortcuts among video editing programs. J is notorious for rewinding, K stops, and L fast forwards video and YouTube uses the same shortcuts. Programs or websites that minimize the amount of time that their users go from a slow operation to an automatic and faster operation will likely see more success.

A bad example of consistency among programs can be seen in PhotoShop, as pointed out by the first video (~6:45). Price shows how in one dialogue, it uses the word "Tolerance," but in another it uses "Fuzziness," which can create some confusion. I'm sure everyone has seen an example of an inconsistent website. Most school sites have horrible consistency due to the many different people in control of the design.

##Familiarity
Johnson says "… people learn from their experiences constantly, often without awareness that they are doing it." When people learn from their environments around, they expect consistency based on previous experiences. As mentioned in the first video (~12:40), young children find out that to turn water on in a tap, you twist the knob counter-clockwise. Occasionally, a tap will be the opposite of what everyone expects and results in three things:

* Confusion
* Frustration
* Anger

As mentioned earlier, you'll notice consistency among computer programs. This is because Microsoft and Apple created computer standards so that people only have to learn something once. An example is the left click on mice is used to select and item and the right click opens menus. On websites, many people are familiar with the navigation being at the top and perhaps contact links at the bottom. However, because websites can be used for more than just delivering content, there may be cases where straying from the familiar template is great, but keep in mind:

>If you're <em>not</em> going to use an existing convention, you need to be sure that what you're replacing it with either **(a)** is so clear and self explanatory that there's no learning curve – so it's as good as a convention or **(b)** adds so much value that it's worth the small learning curve.<br>
>If you're going to innovate, you have to understand the value of what you're replacing and many designers tend to underestimate just how much value conventions provide.

##Recognition over Recall
"The relative ease with which we can recognize things rather than recall them is the basis of the graphical user interface (GUI)."
So, basically:

✔ Visually recalling<br>
✖ Remembering

>At the very least, designers should avoid developing systems that burden long-term memory. Yet that is exactly what many interactive systems do. Make it easy for users to switch to faster paths [shortcuts] after they have gained experience. The slower paths [icons] for newcomers should show users faster paths if there are any.
><footer>Johnson, Jeff<br><a class="amazon book" href="http://amzn.to/1hI9g2x">Don't Make Me Think</a></footer>

For example, PhotoShop has a toolbar on the left to let you select specific tools, based on pretty universal symbols. Or, when more familiar and experienced, you can use the keyboard shortcut. This goes back to the command prompt vs. graphical user interface -- it's much easier to the users to have familiar graphics, or a toolbar.

##Error Prevention
Software or web apps that keep a user's best interests in mind will gain trust and loyalty from the user. When they allow preventable errors to occur, we feel betrayed and lose some faith in the software.
A few great examples of this can be found when you're asked to save when you close unsaved work or write a post on FaceBook and click away, it warns you that you're abandoning the page before you've submitted your post. A very similar warning can be found on some sketchy websites that are just trying to keep you on the site. This is where some sites fail to deliver. For example, when I was filling out a (lengthy) form on a website for college, I hit the submit button and apparently I had signed out, but all my data was lost! Needless to say, I was upset and I'm sure I wasn't the first person that happened to. (Since then, I got this awesome plugin, [Lazarus](http://goo.gl/Vr8qlM), that saves what you write in forms, which has saved me on more than one occasion).

This post described the importance of consistency, familiarity, recognition, and error prevention have on a user's experience; Be it on the web, software, or product, user experience is crucial to the health and growth of the community around the product. There are many different subcategories in the spectrum of user experience that are also important to pay attention to, but the four listed above are especially important. There are still four more usability standards that should be addressed (per the compiled table above). To read the rest, click the link below!
