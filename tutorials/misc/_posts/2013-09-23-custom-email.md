#How To Make A Custom Email Address At Your Website
---

{% include ad-post.html %}

Your business needs a website, sure. But even with your very own domain name, having yourname@aol.com ruins all potential professionalism that you may have established on your [business card]({{ site.url }}/free-business-cards-to-promote-your-business). But with the uniformity of having your personal email (be it gmail, yahoo, or any other email service) connected to your website domain, you reinforce the professionalism of your business. With [Fatcow web hosting](http://www.fatcow.com/join/index.bml?AffID=710737), it’s quite simple (and I’m sure it is with other web hosting services) and should be taken advantage.

##Custom Email Process With Fatcow

* Log into your control panel
* Navigate to Mail Central

* Click on the Accounts tab and check the circle "Reply from the same address the message was sent to" and then "Add another email address you own"

* Type in your name and custom email address

* The "Treat as an alias" option should be used when your new, custom address represents yourself. If the other address represents another person (such as your boss) or a mailing list, it should not be used.

* On the next screen, I recommend choosing "Send through Gmail (easier to set up)," unless you know more about the subject.

* Click “Send Verification” to send a verification number to your custom email.

Now every time someone sends an email to your custom email address, you will get a copy in your Gmail inbox. If you click reply to that email, it will be sent from you custom email to help add professionalism to your business.
