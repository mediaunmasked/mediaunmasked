#Best Ways To Earn Money By Searching Google/Bing
---

{% include ad-post.html %}

There are many different ways you can use <a href="http://swagbucks.com/refer/MediaUnmasked">SwagBucks</a> to earn points that can be redeemed for money by doing things online. There are other programs similar to SwagBucks that encourage people to use their product, such as Microsoft's search engine, Bing. While there are dozens of online rewarding sites, I think SwagBucks is, currently, the best, in terms of usability and rewards. There are many different ways to earn SwagBucks, including the following:

* Search
* Swag codes
* No obligation special offers (NOSO)
* Daily crave
* Daily poll
* Watch videos
* Play games
* Fill out offers
* Shop
* Trade
* Membership

###Search
SwagBucks makes it possible for you to earn more by doing different activities, but the traditional method and probably the most reliable is just by using the search engine, which is a combination of a few different search engines like Google and Yahoo. The most popular and probably the **best method of getting SwagBucks** is by simply setting your search engine to use SwagBucks. Because Swagbucks uses Google results, you won't miss much of the content that you would have found otherwise (if there is something that you need the best results for, just go to [Google](http://google.com). The layout is a bit different, so it might take some getting used to. I actually like the image and video result page -- maybe even more than Google's. Each browser allows you to get a toolbar, extension, or plugin of some sort that makes it easier to do all the activities related to earning SwagBucks, including search. If you're using Google Chrome, the process to set up SwagBucks as your default search engine (when you search in the address bar) is quite simple.

<img class="alignright" src="http://i.imgur.com/F0V9HGY.jpg" />

1. Right click the address bar at the top of Chrome and select "Edit search engines..."
2. Scroll down until you see the form to add a new search engine
3. In the first field, type in Swagbucks
4. In the second field, type in any keyword you want.
5. In the third field, paste the following: `http://www.swagbucks.com/?f=2&amp;t=w&amp;p=1&amp;q=%s`
6. Click the blue "Make default" button to the right (when you hover your mouse over it)
7. Now, when you type anything in the top bar, you'll use SwagBucks to search for it

Just set it as your default browser and forget about it. You'll occasionally earn anywhere from *about **5-50** points* on a search. Search when you need to search and the points will add up. I believe there is a limit to the amount of points you can earn by searching per hour, so just use it as normal and don't try to game the system.

###Swag Codes
Often there is a code that SwagBucks will shout on their social media and, when entered, will get you some free points. Some days there are many and some days there is only one code. For each code, you can usually *win anywhere from **1 to 5** SwagBucks*. To make it easier, there are sites like [swagcode spoilers](http://sc-s.com/) that post the codes directly on their site. If you only do two things to get SwagBucks, it would be search and enter the codes (some days they give out many points, so it's worth using).

###No Obligation Special Offers (NOSO)
This is a pretty simple one. Once a day, you can do No Obligation Special Offers, or *NOSO* for short. Just click skip on all the offers and you're rewarded with *about **2** SwagBucks*!

###Daily Crave
Daily crave is a new feature they introduced that reminds me a lot like StumpleUpon. The difference is that you need to stay on the featured site for about 40 seconds before you can go to the next. Once you visit two sites, you get a *whopping **1** SwagBuck*. Not the best reward, but it's another way to earn. You can do this as much as you want.

###Daily Poll
To earn another *whole **1** SwagBuck*, you can do the daily poll. It's as simple as going to the poll page, clicking an option, and then submitting it. Much faster than the daily crave, but you're limited to one per day.

###Watch Videos
If you want to get a few more SwagBucks by doing other activities, they offer different options, one of which is watching videos. On the desktop site, *you need to watch 10 videos to get the reward, which is **3** SwagBucks*. The videos can be a few minutes long each, so this process can take a while. I mean, you watch YouTube videos for free, so this isn't that bad. Some of the videos are actually entertaining. If you want it to run in the background muted, that's fine too. You can earn up to 150 a day by doing this.

There's also an app for Android and iOS called SwagBucks TV. Unlike the desktop video player, the app will autoplay each video (with an advertisement) and reward you 2 SwagBucks every 5 videos watched. Sometimes the app will stop and give you an error, but sometimes I just turn it on and let it go, so it plays in the background.

###Play Games
For this section, you basically need to watch a preroll ad and then play a game for some points, depending on your score. If you use an ad blocker, you'll need to disable it if you want to get points playing the games. You'll also need Adobe flash player because the games are flash games. I would only recommend this method if you really enjoy the game and find it entertaining, seeing as *the payout isn't great*. If you're <em>really</em> into a particular game, you can participate in a tournament. Tournaments have an entry fee of a few SwagBucks and the first, second, and third place people get a SwagBucks payout.

###Fill Out Offers
There are special offers, similar to the no obligation special offers, but these have an obligation for you to do, but *you'll earn more points*. If you fill out these forms, you might want to use a dedicated spam email, because they're likely to send you some.

###Shop
If you shop under the categories listed on the [SwagBucks shop page](http://www.swagbucks.com/shop), you can *earn a specified amount of SwagBucks per dollar spent*, which can be nice if you planned on buying something anyway. I haven't yet used this, but there are many stores supported - even Amazon!

###Trade In
You can trade in your old electronics or books for some SwagBucks. Sometimes trade in programs aren't the best way to get the most money from your old things, so beware. Remember that roughly 100 SwagBucks = 1 dollar if you're buying gift cards. However, if you're looking to just get rid of old games, maybe the trade in program would be perfect.

###Accelerator Program
SwagBucks is completely free to get everything it has to offer, but if you know you earn enough points to justify it, you can sign up for their Accelerator Program that will double or triple your earnings. The first level doubles your points earned up to 700 points that costs $5 per month. Anything above that and you're profiting. The top level costs $10 per month but triples your SwagBucks rewards up to 1500 per month. So, the only justification to buying this would be *if you're sure you can get at least 450 points in a month*.

###Rewards
So what do you do with [yet another digital currency](http://mediaunmasked.com/reviews/software/bitcoin)? Well, with certain amount of SwagBucks, you can buy different gift cards - the most popular and cheapest being Amazon. There are also physical items that you can purchase, but they cost *a lot* more than small gift cards (and in some cases it's more economically efficient to get the gift cards). I've gotten **over $150 in Amazon gift cards** since I started searching with SwagBucks. I bought my <a href="http://amzn.to/1sfrUZA" class="amazon">Logitech G9x mouse</a> with it, which I use every day. You're not going to be making a lot of money in a short amount of time, but the bonus money is a nice little reward that you're currently not getting by using traditional search engines. You can give it a try if you'd like (it's free, of course) - <a href="http://swagbucks.com/refer/MediaUnmasked">sign up</a> and start your long journey to earn some Amazon gift cards just by doing your everyday searches!
