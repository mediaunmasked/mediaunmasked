#20 Plugins For Chrome
---

{% include ad-post.html %}

These first few plugins are great for anyone and should be used if you browse with Chrome. They will help you with everyday browsing and will likely save you time. The next plugins are ideal for web developers.

###AlienTube For YouTube

Ahh comments: can't live with them, can't live without them. Unfortunately, Google hasn't quite got the filtration formula that we've come to love on Reddit. Reddit's value priority system seems to be the most effective I've seen online and is certainly better than anything YouTube has to offer. To remedy this, there's a plugin (<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/alientube-for-youtube/opgodjgjgojjkhlmmhdlojfehcemknnp">AlienTube</a>) that replaces the YouTube comments section with those from subreddits that have posted a link to the video. You can click between the different submitted subreddits or click over to the YouTube comments if you so dare.

###Checker Plus for Gmail
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/xYvAnHX.jpg" alt="Checker Plus for Gmail Chrome extension notification test" class="thumb pull-left">
<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/checker-plus-for-gmail/oeopbcgkkoapgobdbedcemjljbihmemj">Checker Plus for Gmail</a> is my most used plugin for Chrome. For me, email is an important form of communication and speedy replies are important factor in it. My phone shoots off a notification when I get an email, but I spend quite a bit of time on the computer, so this plugin does just that: checks my email every so often and sends a notification when I get something new. There are plenty of these, but I found this one to be the most extensive, customizable, and simple. By donating the author some money, you can unlock the branding and other features — worth it!

###Chrome Currency Converter
How much is €10 in dollars? Beats me. Good thing we have technology and smart developers in the world who can create cool things like this plugin, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chrome-currency-converter/anbfhidldjknonaihbalghlebaijealk">Currency Converter</a>, that will automatically convert foreign currencies to our personal preferred currency.

###Goo.gl URL Shortener
With a right click, you can <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/googl-url-shortener/iblijlcdoidgdpfknkckljiocdbnlagk">shorten any page or image</a> with goo.gl and copy the shortened url to you clipboard. There's also public statistics and graphs for clicks on goo.gl.

###Google Cast
If you have a Chromecast, then you probably have <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-cast/boadgeojelhgndaghljhdicfkmllpafd">Google Cast</a>. If you don't have a Chromecast, you're probably paying too much for cable.

###Google Dictionary
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/xInTH2k.jpg" alt="Google Dictionary Chrome extension" class="pull-left thumb">
With <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-dictionary-by-goog/mgijmajocgfcbeboacabfgobmjgjcoja">Google Dictionary</a>, double click any word to get the definition right then and there. I remember in school, we'd have to look through a paper book to find the definition of a word. With this plugin, you don't even have to search for the word on a website. Just double click to get the definition right there. IT will even pronounce it if you want!

###Hangouts
<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hangouts/nckgahadagoaajjgafhacjanaoiihapd">Google Hangouts</a> have taken over Google's free calling service, Voice. You can still call and text people for free with a unique phone number, but it's now merged with Google Hangouts. This plugin adds an item to your taskbar and will popup when someone calls or texts you. If you miss the call, you still get an email with the message and (attempted) transcript, so things haven't changed much. <3 Google overlords

###Hover Zoom
If you frequent Reddit, this plugin will become one of your best friends. Simply, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hover-zoom/nonjdcjchghhkdoolnlbekcfllmednbl">it pulls the imgur image</a> (or other) and pops it up in your current window, so you can view images without leaving reddit. It will work on other sites or you can limit it (or block) to specific sites that you want images to pop up on.

###Keepa
<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keepa-price-tracker/neebplgakaahbhdphmkckjjcegoiijjo">Keepa</a> is pretty similar to camelcamelcamel, in that it gives you the price history of an item on Amazon. It also gives you the option be notified when the price lowers. It's helpful if you want to ensure you're not buying an item that just jumped up or to encourage you to buy if the item is at a low price.

###Lazarus
<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lazarus-form-recovery/loljledaigphbcpfhfmgopdkppkifgno">Lazarus</a> has saved me on more than one occasion. Have you ever filled in a form only to find it timed out or you lost internet connection? This happened to me a few times when I was filling out scholarship applications. You only have to write thousands of words on multiple prompts and then have it all deleted because there was a timeout session a few times before you think of searching for such a plugin. Let me save you the headache: get the plugin, now!

###Looper for YouTube
This little plugin adds a button below YouTube videos to <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/looper-for-youtube/iggpfpnahkgpnindfkdncknoldgnccdg">enable looping</a> for a number of times or infinitely. It's basic, but it does its purpose exactly.

###Reddit Enhancement Suite
This is another redditor must-have. It <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/reddit-enhancement-suite/kbmfpngjjgdllneeigpgjifpgocmfgmb">extends the site extraordinarily well</a> from the interface enhancements to simple functionalities you didn't know you wanted. Easily switch between accounts, "night" viewing mode, and a few other things.

###Reddit Hide Sidebar
Reddit sucks on phones because it's not "responsive," meaning the text is small and you have to pinch to zoom in and all that jazz. Even if it does look fine on your phone, sometimes if you have side-by-side windows, it can be a little cramped. With that, there's a plugin that lets you <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/reddit-hide-sidebar/kmhljmlnmkpkfidhceknegheeplgmngg">hide the sidebar</a>, taking advantage (on most subreddits) of the full width of your screen for the content. It conveniently adds a show/hide link by the other important links in the top right.

###SpeakIt
Sometimes you can't or just don't want to read an article, but you want to know the information in it. With this plugin, you can <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/speakit/pgeolalilifpodheeocdmbhehgnkkbak">have a (very robotic) voice read it</a> to you when you select text and click the right click option.

###Stylish
This plugin extends all websites to your <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe">personal styling</a>. With a little bit of CSS knowledge, you can hide specific elements, or alter others on any website.

###Video Speed
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/7Fjc1Cr.jpg" alt="YouTube Video Speed Chrome extention">
Similar to SpeakIt, sometimes you just need the information, but can't or don't want to consume it the traditional method — but this time for videos. <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-speed/fnjmlegmhldjolpmcfjhooibnchlafgg">Video Speed</a> lets you change the playback speed of both YouTube and Vimeo videos with the bracket keys, [ and ]. This is currently a function built into YouTube's player, but it's simpler with the hotkeys. I've used this to speed through school lectures in half (or less) the time than it would've taken otherwise.

###Web Timer
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/Hh2MCMr.jpg" alt="Web Timer Chrome extention">
<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-timer/ggnjbdfgigejghknieofeahaknkjafim" class="thumb pull-left">Web Timer</a> just tracks the time you spend on any website and then gives you a graph. It's not particularly helpful, but it is really interesting to see how much time is spent on each website. I like to hide the button and just keep it activated so it continues to collect data and then I can view it at a later point when more time has passed.

##For Developers

###Livereload
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/ukefYUO.jpg" alt="Livereload manage extension">
<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei">Livereload</a>, when enabled, injects a snippet of code into your file (temporarily) in conjunction with the desktop app or plugin for Sublime Text or other software to automatically refresh the page when a project file is saved. There are other (command line) alternatives like <a href="http://browsersync.io">Browsersync</a>, but Livereload was one of the first simple solutions for those of us who are command line illiterate (I've since found the importance, simplicity, and power of a CLI). There are over 165k users of Livereload.

**Note:** You need to right click the plug, click manage plugin, then check the box that says ‘Allow access to file URLs'. This will ensure Livereload works on local files.

###LiveStyle
If you've ever used Emmet (previously Zen coding), you will wonder how you lived without it. The same people have developed a bi-directional CSS editing called <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/emmet-livestyle/diebikgmpmeppiilkaijjbdgciafajmg">LiveStyle</a>. This means when you make changes to CSS in Chrome's DevTools, they update in your local files. This, similar to Livereload, requires a plugin on the other side. Unlike Livereload, you there's currently only support for Sublime Text. Some might argue that you can do this natively in Chrome's DevTools, which is true, but LiveStyle allows for bi-directional editing of LESS and SCSS files, while DevTools is limited to CSS. There are currently over 48k users of LiveStyle.

###Whatfont?
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/jf8hHCO.jpg" alt="Whatfont Chrome Plugin" class="thumb pull-left">
Whatfont is handy when, well… you want to know what font a website is using. It's a tool-tip style overlay that gives you the font of the hovered element. Clicking the elements gives you more information, like the font size, line height, where the font is served, the hex, etc. There are over 400k users of Whatfont.

##Conclusion
The *best* thing about the internet is that a lot of it is open for development; open for improvement for everyone. If there's not an extension, site, app, etc. then you can just build it yourself (or pay someone to do it for you). Let me know if there are any plugins that you absolutely love so I can check them out.
